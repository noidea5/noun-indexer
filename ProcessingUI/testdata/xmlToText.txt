PREFACE
The great Danish philosopher and religious thinker, Soren
Kierkegaard, once wrote, "It is the sign of a good book when the
book reads you."
You hold in your hands such a book — one that has not only
become a classic in the self-help field, but also has that rare
ability to relate to your problems, sympathize with them, and then
advise you on their solutions as a wise old friend would.
Still, I must warn you.
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude will do nothing for
you. If you truly wish to change your life for the better, and are
willing to pay a price in time and thinking and effort to reach
your goals — and if you're not kidding yourself — then you hold
in your hands a diamond plucked from a beach of pebbles, a road
map to a better future, a valuable blueprint that will enable you to
completely restructure your future.
I speak from experience. Many years ago, through my own
stupidities and faults, I lost everything that was precious to me —
my family, my home and my job. Nearly penniless, and with no
guidance, I began to wander the country, searching for myself
and for some answers that would make my life bearable.
I spent much time in public libraries because they were free —
and warm. I read everything from Plato to Peale, seeking that one
message that would explain to me where I had gone wrong —
and what I could do to salvage the remainder of my life.
I finally found my answer in W. Clement Stone's and Napoleon
Hill's Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude. I have
employed the simple techniques and methods found in this classic
for more than fifteen years, and they have provided me with
riches and happiness far beyond anything I deserve. From a
penniless vagrant without a single root, I eventually became the
president of two corporations and the executive editor of the
finest magazine of its kind in the world, Success Unlimited. I also
wrote six books, and one of them, The Greatest Salesman in the
World, has now become the best-selling book for salespeople of
all time; it has been translated into fourteen languages and has
sold more than three million copies.
None of these things would have been accomplished without the
daily application of the principles of success and living that I
found in Stone's and Hill's classic. If I could accomplish what I
did starting from ground zero, just think what you can do with all
you have going for you already.
We live in a strange and fast-moving world; each day a new false
prophet arises preaching his own brand of happiness and success
attainment. Like hula hoops and pet rocks they will all disappear
as quickly as they appeared, and when the fog lifts, the truth of
Stone's and Hill's book will still be changing the lives of
thousands yet unborn.
Do you really want to change your life for the better?
If you do, Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude can be the
luckiest thing that has ever happened to you. Read it. Study it.
Read it again. Then get into action. It's all very simple, really, if
you make up your mind to work at it.
And wonderful things will begin happening to you.
I should know.

INTRODUCTION
Every inspirational, self-help action book, including this one,
should be evaluated by what happens to you, the reader, as a
result of the book's power to motivate you to motivate yourself to
desirable action. By this standard, Success Through a Positive
Mental Attitude is reputed to be one of the outstandingly
successful inspirational, self-help action books of this century. It
has inspired countless thousands of men, women, and teenagers
to acquire good physical, mental and moral health; seek
happiness; pursue wealth and reach for high goals or other
objectives that do not violate the laws of God or the rights of their
fellow men.
Something wonderful is going to happen to you — if you are
ready. To prepare yourself to be ready, understand clearly
Andrew Carnegie's observation that all achievement, all earned
riches, have their beginning in an idea!
Before proceeding further, I'd like to give you a background of
my co-author. Dr. Napoleon Hill.
Think and grow rich. Think and Grow Rich, the book by
Napoleon Hill, has motivated more persons throughout the world
to acquire wealth and succeed in their careers than any book
written in the twentieth century. Its author was born in poverty in
a log cabin in Wise County, Virginia, on October 1883, and he
passed away in Greenville, South Carolina, on November 8,
1970.
As a boy, young Hill was blessed, inspired and motivated to high
achievement by his calm, patient stepmother who loved him
dearly. It was she, who motivated "a problem child" to develop
character and motivate himself to work hard to become educated
and an achiever.
12
In 1908, while working for a magazine and attending college,
young Hill was assigned to interview Andrew Carnegie, the great
steelmaker, philosopher and philanthropist.
Andrew Carnegie was so impressed with his interviewer that he
invited him to his home as a guest. Hour after hour each day
during the three-day visit, the two men discussed philosophy. The
elder romanced the lives of philosophers and the impact their
philosophy had had on world civilization to the younger, who
listened with rapture.
In his discussions, Carnegie made it a point to express in simple,
clear language the principles involved and the concepts of each of
the philosophers he romanced. And he told something more: how
to apply those principles in everyday living as they pertain to an
individual, his family, his career or any human activity.
A challenge. Andrew Carnegie knew human nature. One way to
motivate an aggressive extrovert with a high energy level who
has drive and stick-to-itiveness, and whose reason and emotions
are in balance, is to challenge him. The young guest was just such
a person. And he was challenged.
"What is there in the climate of this great nation whereby I, a
foreigner, can build a business and acquire wealth — or anyone
can achieve success?" asked Carnegie. And before Hill could
answer, he continued, "I challenge you to devote 20 years of your
life to the study of the philosophy of American achievement and
come up with an answer. Will you accept?"
"Yes!" was the quick response.
Andrew Carnegie had an obsession: Anything in life worth having
was worth working for. He was willing to give the young author
his personal time to consult with him and letters of introduction
13
to the outstanding Americans of his day, and to reimburse him for
any necessary out-of-pocket expense, such as traveling to
interview people. But it was clearly understood that Napoleon
Hill would have to earn his own livelihood.
In the following 20 years, Hill interviewed over 500 successful
men. Among them were Henry Ford, William Wrigley, Jr., John
Wanamaker, George Eastman, John D. Rockefeller, Thomas A.
Edison, Theodore Roosevelt, Albert Hubbard, J. Ogden Armour,
Luther Burbank, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell and Julius
Rosenwald.
And Hill did earn his own livelihood — by applying many of the
principles he learned from Carnegie and the men he interviewed.
And in 1928, he completed the eight volumes of The Law of
Success — books that motivated thousands to acquire wealth or
to become outstanding achievers.
On the recommendation of Senator Jennings Randolph of West
Virginia, Napoleon Hill became an adviser to two Presidents of
the United States: Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
He influenced certain decisions they made that affected the
course of American history.
When, exactly twenty years after the interview with Andrew
Carnegie, The Law of Success was published, it had a worldwide
impact. Seven years later, while be was an adviser to Franklin D.
Roosevelt, he began writing the manuscript for Think and Grow
Rich. It was published in 1937. More than ten million people
have read the book.
A profitable discovery. In 1937, Think and Grow Rich was given
to me by Morris Pickus, a well-known sales executive, sales
counselor and lecturer. The philosophy in so many respects
coincided with my own that I sent the book to every one of my
14
sales representatives throughout the United States. (At that time, I
owned and operated Combined Registry Company, a national
sales organization that specialized exclusively in the sale of
accident insurance.)
Bingo! I hit the jackpot, for I made a profitable discovery. I found
a working tool that would motivate sales representatives to
motivate themselves to increase their sales and profits — and
something more: to acquire wealth through responding to an
inspirational, self-help action book.
"Now, what has relating the story about Carnegie, The Law of
Success and Think and Grow Rich to do with Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude?" you ask. My answer: "If it were not
for each of them, the manuscript for this book would not have
been written. But it was written, and it was first published in
1960 by Prentice-Hall, Inc.
Think and Grow Rich contains the basic principles of
Andrew Carnegie's philosophy — those contained in The Law of
Success — and Napoleon Hill's philosophy and experiences, as
well as stories about many people who acquired wealth and
success after reading the eight volumes of The Law of Success.
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude combines all these in
essence, and has something more. It tells specifically how you
can use the greatest machine that was ever conceived — a
machine so awesome that only God Himself could create it. This
machine is a human computer; it is your brain and your nervous
system, from which the mechanical computer was designed.
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude instructs you on what
to do and how to do it when it comes to tapping and using the
powers of your subconscious mind. Where have you been taught
to constructively use, neutralize, control or harmonize with your
passions, emotions, instincts, tendencies, feelings, moods and
15
habits of thought and action? Have you been taught how to aim
high and achieve your goals regardless of the obstacles? If your
answer is "No." you will be taught these things if you read and
then apply the principles in Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude.
Results are what count. Over the last 16 years, more than
420,000 hardbound copies of Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude have been printed. Our readers have had such
phenomenal results in changing their lives for the better, meeting
life's problems courageously and bringing their desires into
reality that I was delighted when arrangements were made for
Pocket Books to publish the paperback edition, for the books
published by Pocket Books reach hundreds of thousands. And my
chief goal, and Napoleon Hill's, was to motivate multitudes of
people to free themselves from the slavery of their undesirable
thoughts, habits and actions and to help them seek and acquire the
true riches of life by fulfilling desires that don't violate the laws
of God or the rights of their fellow men.
Freedom from the bonds that enslaved them. In the preface by
Og Mandino to this edition of Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude, you read:
I speak from experience. Many years ago, through my
own stupidities and faults, I lost everything that was
precious to me — my family, my home and my job.
Nearly penniless, and with no guidance, I began to
wander the country, searching for myself and for some
answers that would make life bearable. . . .
I finally found my answer in W. Clement Stone's and
Napoleon Hill's Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude.
16
Og Mandino is now famous as a lecturer and author of The
Greatest Salesman in the World and other self-help books. And
Norman Vincent Peale and other well-known authors have told
me many times how they have inspired others to high personal
achievement by quoting illustrations and principles from Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude.
I was recently invited to dinner at one of Washington's famous
restaurants by a friend. Jimmy, the waiter, rendered the most
pleasant and effective service I have ever gotten at any fine
restaurant in any part of the world. After dinner, as my party was
leaving the restaurant, Jimmy asked me aside and said, "May I
take half a minute of your time?"
"Certainly." I responded.
"I just wanted to tell you that Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude saved my life," he said.
Another man, Ted G., told me: "When I was on the Lee Phillips
Show, you said you were going to change my life. Well, you did,
and here's a list of the changes that took place in five years: I
went into business, and I m doing very well: two of my daughters
graduated from college, and one is still attending a private college
(previously I had no funds for college education for them); I
purchased a condominium with a swimming pool, golf course,
etc.: I've had beautiful vacations: and much more! Many thanks
again for Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude. It is always
on my night table and I consider it one of my valued
possessions."
A doctor who practices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on two
occasions when I met him said, "I thought you would be
interested in knowing that one of my most effective prescriptions
17
to certain patients with psychosomatic illnesses is a special one.
I prescribe a book:   Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude."
While there are several thousands of experiences that could be
related, the greatest testimonial can be your experience when you
learn and apply the principles in this book.
Special instructions. When you read this book, read it as if the
authors were your personal friends and were writing to you —
and you alone. Underscore sentences, quotations and words that
are meaningful to you. Memorize self-motivators. Keep in mind
that this is a book to motivate you to desirable action.
Abraham Lincoln developed the habit of trying to learn from the
books he read, the people he met and casual events. These gave
him ideas for reflection. And thus he was able to relate, assimilate
and use ideas as his own.
You too can convert your creative thinking, artistic talent,
knowledge, personality and physical energy into success, wealth,
health and happiness. This book more than tells you how: it
motivates you to try.
Look for the message that is applicable to you. When you
recognize it. Pay attention! Get into action! To direct your mind
into desired channels, try to answer each question at the end of
each chapter during your thinking and planning time.

PARTI
Where the Road to Achievement Begins
CHAPTER 1
Meet the Most Important Living Person
Meet the most important living person!
Somewhere in this book, you will meet him — suddenly,
surprisingly and with a shock of recognition that will change your
whole life. When you do meet him, you will discover his secret.
You will discover that he carries with him an invisible talisman
with the initials PMA emblazoned on one side, and NMA on the
other.
This invisible talisman has two amazing powers: it has the power
to attract wealth, success, happiness and health; and it has the
power to repel these things — to rob you of all that makes life
worth living. It is the first of these powers, PMA, that enables
some men to climb to the top and stay there. It is the second that
keeps other men at the bottom all their lives. It is NMA that pulls
other men down from the top when they have reached it.
Perhaps the story of S. B. Fuller will illustrate how it works.
"We are poor — not because of God." S. B. Fuller was one of
seven children of a Negro tenant farmer in Louisiana. He started
to work at the age of five. By the time he was nine, he was
driving mules. There was nothing unusual in this: the children of
most of the tenant farmers went to work early. These families
accepted poverty as their lot and asked for no better.
Young Fuller was different from his friends in one way: he had a
remarkable mother. His mother refused to accept this hand-to-
19
mouth existence for her children, though it was all she had ever
known. She knew there was something wrong with the fact that
her family was barely getting along in a world of joy and plenty.
She used to talk to her son about her dreams.
"We shouldn't be poor, S. B.," she used to say. "And don't ever let
me hear you say that it is God's Will that we are poor. We are
poor — not because of God. We are poor because father has
never developed a desire to become rich. No one in our family
has ever developed a desire to be anything else."
No one had developed a desire to be wealthy. This idea became
so deeply ingrained in Fuller's mind that it changed his whole
life. He began to want to be rich. He kept his mind on the things
he did want and off the things, he didn't want. Thus, he developed
a burning desire to become rich. The quickest way to make
money, he decided, was to sell something. He chose soap. For
twelve years he sold it, door to door. Then he learned that the
company which supplied him was going to be sold at auction.
The firm price was $150,000. In twelve years of selling and
setting aside every penny, he had saved $25,000. It was agreed
that he would deposit his $25,000 and obtain the balance of
$125,000 within a ten-day period. Written into the contract was
the condition that if he did not raise the money, he would lose his
deposit.
During his twelve years as a soap salesman, S. B. Fuller had
gained the respect and admiration of many businessmen. He went
to them now. He obtained money from personal friends, too, and
from loan companies and investment groups. On the eve of the
tenth day, he had raised $115,000 He was $10,000 short.
Search for the light. "I had exhausted every source of credit I
knew," he recalls. "It was late at night. In the darkness of my
room, I knelt down and prayed. I asked God to lead me to a
20
person who would let me have the $10,000 in time. I said to
myself that I would drive down 61st Street until I saw the first
light in a business establishment. I asked God to make the light a
sign indicating His answer."
It was eleven o'clock at night when S. B. Fuller drove down
Chicago's 61st Street. At last, alter several blocks he saw a light
in a contractor's office.
He walked in. There, seated at his desk, tired from working late at
night, sat a man whom Fuller knew slightly. Fuller realized that
he would have to be bold,
"Do you want to make $1,000?" asked Fuller straight out. The
contractor was taken aback at the question. "Yes," he said. "Of
course."
"Then make out a check for $10,000 and when I bring back the
money, I'll bring back another $1,000 profit," Fuller recalls
telling this man. He gave the contractor the names of the other
people who had lent him money, and explained in detail exactly
what the business venture was.
Let's explore his secret of success. Before he left that night, S.
B. Fuller had a check for $10,000 in his pocket. Subsequently, he
obtained controlling interest not only in that company, but in
seven others, including four cosmetic companies, a hosiery
company, a label company, and a newspaper. When we asked
him recently to explore with us the secret of his success, he
answered in terms of his mother's statement so many years
before:
"We are poor — not because of God. We are poor because father
has never developed a desire to become rich. No one in our
family has ever developed a desire to be anything else."
21
"You see," he told us, "I knew what I wanted, but I didn't know
how to get it. So I read The Bible and inspirational books for a
purpose. I prayed for the knowledge to achieve my objectives.
Three books played an important part in transmuting my burning
desire into reality. They were: (1) The Bible, (2) Think and Grow
Rich, and (3) The Secret of the Ages. My greatest inspiration
comes from reading The Bible.
"If you know what you want, you are more apt to recognize it
when you see it. When you read a book, for example, you will
recognize opportunities to help you get what you want."
S. B. Fuller carried with him the invisible talisman with the
initials PMA imprinted on one side and NMA on the other. He
turned the PMA side up and things happened. He was able to
bring into reality ideas that were formerly mere daydreams.
Now the important thing to notice here is that S. B. Fuller started
life with fewer advantages than most of us have. But he chose a
big goal and headed for it of course, the choice of goal was
individual. In these times and in this country you still have your
personal right to say; "This is what I choose. This is what I want
most to accomplish." And unless your goal is against the laws of
God or society, you can achieve it. You have everything to gain
and nothing to lose by trying. Success is achieved and maintained
by those who keep trying with PMA.
What you try for is up to you. Not everyone would care to be an
S. B. Fuller, responsible for large manufacturing concerns. Not
everyone would choose to pay the costly price of being a great
artist. To many, the riches of life are quite different. A skill in
day-to-day living which adds up to a happy, love-filled life is
success. You can have this and other riches too. The choice is
yours.
22
But whether success to you means becoming rich as it did to S. B.
Fuller, or the discovery of a new element in chemistry, or the
creation of a piece of music, or the growing of a rose, or the
nurturing of a child — no matter what success means to you —
the invisible talisman with the initials PMA emblazoned on one
side and NMA on the other can help you achieve it You attract
the good and desirable with PMA. You repel them with NMA.
Every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater
benefit. "But what if I have a physical handicap? How can a
change of attitude help me?" you may ask. Perhaps the story of
Tom Dempsey, a boy who was disabled at birth, will give you
your answer.
Tom was born without half a right foot and only a stub of a right
arm. As a boy, he wanted to engage in sports as the other boys
did. He had a burning desire to play football. Because of this
desire, his parents had an artificial foot made for him. It was
made of wood. The wooden foot was encased in a special stubby
football shoe. Hour after hour, day after day, Tom would practice
kicking the football with his wooden foot. He would try and keep
on trying to make field goals at greater and greater distances. He
became so proficient that he was hired by the New Orleans
Saints.
The screams of 66,910 football fans could be heard throughout
the entire United States when, within the last two seconds of the
game, Tom Dempsey — with his crippled leg — kicked a record-
breaking 63-yard field goal. It was the longest field goal ever
kicked in a professional football game. It gave the Saints a
winning score of 19-17 over the Detroit Lions.
"We were beaten by a miracle," said Detroit coach Joseph
Schmidt. And to many, it was a miracle — an answer to a prayer.
23
"Tom Dempsey didn't kick that field goal, God kicked it," said
Lion linebacker Wayne Walker.
"Interesting. But what does the Tom Dempsey story mean to
me?" you may ask.
Our response would be: "Very little — unless you develop the
habit of recognizing, relating, assimilating and using universal
principles and adopt them as your very own. Then follow through
with desirable action."
And what are the principles you could apply from the Tom
Dempsey story, whether or not you are physically disabled? They
can be learned and applied by children and adults:
• Greatness comes to those who develop a burning
desire to achieve high goals.
• Success is achieved and maintained by those who try
and keep on trying with PMA.
• To become an expert achiever in any human activity, it
takes practice . . . practice . . . practice.
• Effort and work can become fun when you establish
specific desirable goals.
• With every adversity there is a seed of an equivalent or
greater benefit for those who are motivated with PMA
to become achievers.
• Man's greatest power lies in the power of prayer.
To learn and apply these principles, turn up your invisible
talisman to the PMA side.
When Henley wrote the poetic lines, "I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul," he could have informed us that we
24
are the masters of our fate because we are masters, first, of our
attitudes. Our attitudes shape our future. This is a universal law.
The poet could have told us with great emphasis that this law
works whether the attitudes are destructive or constructive. The
law states that we translate into physical reality the thoughts and
attitudes which we hold in our minds, no matter what they are.
We translate into reality thoughts of poverty just as quickly as we
do thoughts of riches. But when our attitude towards ourselves is
big, and our attitude towards others is generous and merciful, we
attract big and generous portions of success.
A truly great man. Consider the example of Henry J. Kaiser, a
truly successful person because his attitude towards himself is
big. Companies identified with the name Henry J. Kaiser hold
assets of more than one billion dollars. Because he is generous
and merciful to others, the speechless have been made to talk, the
crippled have been restored to useful lives, and hundreds of
thousands of persons have received hospital care at a very low
cost All this grew from seeds of thought planted within him by
his mother.
Mary Kaiser gave her son Henry the priceless gift. She also
taught him to apply the greatest value in life.
1. The priceless gift: After her day's work, Mary Kaiser would
spend hours as a volunteer nurse, helping the unfortunate. Often
she said to her son, "Henry, nothing is ever accomplished without
work. If I leave you nothing else but the will to work, I will have
left you the priceless gift: the joy of work."
2. The greatest value in life: "It was my mother," said Mr. Kaiser,
"who first taught me some of the greatest values in life. Among
these were the love of people and the importance of serving
others. Loving people and serving them, she used to say, is the
greatest value in life."
25
Henry J. Kaiser knows the power of PMA. He knows what it can
do in his life and for his country. He also knows the force of
NMA. During World War II he built over 1500 ships with such
rapidity that he startled the world. When he said, "We can
construct a Liberty Ship every ten days," the experts said, "It can't
be done — it's impossible!" Yet Kaiser did it. Those who believe
they can't repel the positive; they use the negative side of their
talisman. Those who believe they can repel the negative; they use
the positive side.
That is why we must be cautions when we use this talisman. Its
PMA side can get for you all the rich blessings of life. It can help
you to overcome your difficulties and to discover your strengths.
It can help you step out ahead of your competitors, and, as with
Kaiser, it can turn what others say is impossible into reality.
But the NMA side is just as powerful. Instead of happiness and
success, it can attract despair and defeat. Like all power, the
talisman is dangerous if we do not use it properly.
How the force of NMA repels. There is a very interesting story,
which illustrates how the force of NMA repels. It comes out of
one of the southern states. There, where wood-burning fireplaces
are still used to heat homes, lived a woodcutter who also was an
unsuccessful person. For more than two years, he had supplied a
certain homeowner with firewood. The woodcutter knew that the
logs could not be larger than seven inches in diameter if they
were to fit this particular fireplace.
On one occasion this old customer ordered a cord of wood, but
was away when it was delivered. On arriving home he discovered
that most of the wood was larger than the specified size. He
called the woodcutter and asked him to have the oversized logs
exchanged or split.
26
"I can't do that!" said the wood dealer. "It would cost more than
the whole load is worth." With that he hung up.
So the homeowner was left with the job of splitting the logs
himself. He rolled up his sleeves and set to work. About halfway
through the job he noticed that one particular log had a very large
knothole which someone had plugged up. The homeowner lifted
the log. It seemed unusually light and appeared to be hollow.
With a hefty swing of the axe he split the log.
A blackened roll of tin foil fell out. The homeowner stooped
down, picked up the roll and unwrapped it. To his amazement it
contained very old $50 and $100 bills. Slowly he counted them.
They amounted to exactly $2,250. The bills had evidently been in
the tree for many years, as the paper was very brittle. The
homeowner had PMA. His only thought was to get the money
back to its rightful owner. He picked up the telephone, called the
wood dealer again, and asked him where he had cut this load.
Again the woodcutter's NMA asserted its repelling power. That's
nobody's business but mine," he said. "If you give away your
secrets, people will cheat you every time." Despite many efforts,
the homeowner never learned where the logs came from or who
had sealed the money inside.
Now, the point of this story does not lie in irony. It is true that the
man with PMA found the money while the man with NMA had
not. But it is also true that good breaks do occur in everyone's
life. However, the man who lives with NMA will prevent life's
lucky breaks from benefiting him. And the man with PMA will
so arrange his attitudes that he will turn even the bad breaks into
advantages.
On the sales staff of the Combined Insurance Company of
America there was a salesman named Al Allen. Al wanted to be
the  company's   star  salesman.   He  tried  to   apply  the  PMA
27
principles found in the inspirational books and magazines he
read. He read an editorial in Success Unlimited magazine entitled
"Develop Inspirational Dissatisfaction." It wasn't long after that
he had an opportunity to put into practice what he had read. He
had a bad break. This gave him the opportunity to arrange his
attitudes so that he could use the PMA side of his talisman
effectively.
He developed inspirational dissatisfaction. One icy winter
day Al "cold-canvassed" every store in a city block in Wisconsin;
he walked in unannounced, and tried to sell insurance. On that
day, Al did not make a single sale. Of course, he was dissatisfied.
But Al's PMA turned this dissatisfaction into "inspirational
dissatisfaction."
Why?
He remembered the editorial he had read. He applied the
principle. The next day before setting out from the local office, he
told his fellow salesmen about his failures the day before. He
said, "Wait and see. Today I'm going back to call on those same
prospects and I'll sell more insurance than all the rest of you
combined!"
And the remarkable thing is that Al did it. He went back to that
same city block and again called on every person he had talked to
the day before. He sold 66 new accident contracts!
Now, this was an unusual achievement. And it happened because
of the "bad breaks" when Al trudged through the sleet and wind
for eight hours without selling a single policy. Al Allen was able
to rearrange his attitudes. He was able to convert the negative
kind of dissatisfaction that most of us would feel in similar
circumstances of failure on one day into inspirational
dissatisfaction, which resulted in success the next day. Al did
28
become the company's best salesman and was promoted to a sales
manager. This ability to turn the invisible talisman over and use
the side which has the force of PMA rather than the side which
has the force of NMA is characteristic of so many of our really
successful people. Most of us are inclined to look upon success as
coming in some mysterious way through advantage that we do
not have. Perhaps because we do have them, we don't see them.
The obvious is often unseen. Every man's PMA is his advantage,
and there is nothing mysterious about it.
Henry Ford, after he had achieved success, was the subject of
much envy. People felt that because of good fortune, or
influential friends, or genius, or whatever they thought was Ford's
"Secret" — because of these things Ford was successful. And no
doubt some of these elements played a part. But there was
something more. Perhaps one person in every hundred thousand
knew the real reason for Ford's success, and those few were
usually ashamed to speak of it because of its simplicity. A single
glimpse of Ford in action will illustrate the "secret" perfectly.
Years ago, Henry Ford decided to develop the now famous motor
known as V-8. He wanted to build an engine with the entire eight
cylinders cast in one block. He instructed his engineers to
produce a design for such an engine. To a man, the engineers
agreed that it was simply impossible to cast an eight-cylinder
gasoline engine block in one piece.
Ford said, "Produce it anyway."
"But," they replied, "it's impossible."
"Go to work," Ford commanded, "and stay on the job until you
succeed no matter how much time is required."
29
The engineers went to work. There was nothing else for them to
do if they were to remain on the Ford staff. Six months went by
and they had not succeeded. Another six months passed, and still
no success. The more the engineers tried, the more the thing
seemed "impossible."
At the end of the year, Ford checked with his engineers. Once
again they informed him that they had found no way to carry out
his orders. "Keep working," said Ford. "I want it and I'll have it."
And what happened?
Well, of course, the engine wasn't impossible at all. The Ford V-8
became the most spectacularly successful car on the road, pulling
Henry Ford and his company so far out in front of his nearest
competitor that it took years for them to catch up. He was using
PMA. And the same power is available to you. If you use it, if
you turn your talisman to the right side as Henry Ford did, you
too can achieve success in bringing into reality the possibility of
the improbable. If you know what you want, you can find a way
to get it.
A man of 25 has before him some 100,000 working hours should
he retire at 65. How many of your working hours will be alive
with the magnificent force of PMA? And how many of them will
have the life knocked out of them with the stunning blows of
NMA?
But how do you go about putting PMA to work in your life rather
than NMA? Some people seem to use this power instinctively.
When it came to developing the Ford car, Henry Ford was one of
these. Others have to learn. Al Allen learned by relating and
assimilating what he read in inspirational magazines and books.
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude is such a book.
30
You, too, can learn to develop PMA.
Some people use PMA for a while but when they receive a
setback, they lose faith in it. They start out right, but some "bad
breaks" cause them to flip the talisman wrong-side-up. They fail
to realize that success is maintained by those who keep trying
with PMA. They are like the famous old racehorse "John P.
Grier." John P. Grier was a thoroughbred of great promise, such
promise in fact that he was groomed, trained and billed as the
only horse that stood a chance of beating the greatest racehorse of
all time: Man o' War.
Don't let your mental attitude make you a has-been. In the
Dwyer Stakes at Aqueduct in July of 1920, the two horses finally
met. It was a magnificent day. All eyes were riveted on the
starting post. The two horses got away evenly. Down the track
they went side by side. It was clear that John P. Grier was giving
Man o' War the race of his life. At the quarter mark they were
even. The half mark. The three-quarter mark and still they were
even. At the eighth pole — neck and neck. Then in the stretch
John P. Grier brought the crowd to its feet. Slowly he edged
ahead.
It was a moment of crisis for Man o' War's Jockey. He made up
his mind. For the first time in the great horse's career the jockey
nicked him solidly on the rump with his whip. Man o' War
reacted as though the jockey had set fire to his tail. He shot out
ahead and pulled away from John P. Grier as if the other horse
were standing still. At the end of the race Man o' War was seven
lengths ahead.
But the significant thing from our point of view was the effect of
defeat on the other horse. John P. Grier had been a horse of great
spirit; victory was in his attitude. But he was so broken by this
experience that he never really recovered.  All of his races
31
afterwards were weak, half-hearted attempts and he never won
again.
People are not race horses, but this story is reminiscent of far too
many men who, in the boom years of the 1920's, started off with
a wonderful attitude of success. They achieved financial success,
and then, when the Depression struck in 1930, they experienced
defeat. They were crushed. Their attitude changed from positive
to negative. Their talisman flipped to the side that read NMA.
They stopped trying. They, like John P. Grier, became "has-
beens."
Some people seem to use PMA pretty much all the time. Others
start and then quit. But others — the vast majority of us — have
never really begun to use the tremendous powers available to us.
What about us? Can we learn to use PMA, as we've learned other
skills?
The answer, based on our years of experience, is a definite yes.
This is the subject of this book. In the chapters that follow we
will show you how it can be done. The effort to learn will be
worth it because PMA is the essential ingredient in all success.
Meet the most important living person. The day you recognize
PMA for yourself is the day that you will meet the most
important living person! Who is he? Why, the most important
living person is you, as far as you and your life are concerned
Take a look at yourself. Isn't it true that you carry with you an
invisible talisman with the initials PMA emblazoned on one side
and NMA on the other? What exactly is this talisman, this force?
The talisman is your mind PMA is a Positive Mental Attitude.
32
A Positive Mental Attitude is the right mental attitude. What is
the right mental attitude? It is most often comprised of the "plus"
characteristics symbolized by such words as faith, integrity, hope,
optimism, courage, initiative, generosity, tolerance, tact,
kindliness and good common sense. A person with positive
mental attitude aims for high goals and constantly strives to
achieve them.
NMA is a negative mental attitude. It has opposite characteristics
to PMA.
After years spent studying successful men, the authors of Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude have come to the conclusion
that a positive mental attitude is the one simple secret shared by
them all.
It was PMA that helped S. B. Fuller overcome the disadvantages
of poverty. It was PMA that motivated Tom Dempsey, despite his
crippled leg, to kick the longest field goal ever kicked in a
professional football game. And it was certainly a positive mental
attitude that enabled Henry J. Kaiser to build a Liberty Ship every
ten days. It was Al Allen's ability to turn his talisman right-side-
up that motivated him to return to his prospects — the very ones
who had refused him the day before — and set a new sales
record.
Do you know how to make your invisible talisman work for you?
Perhaps you do: perhaps you don't. Perhaps you have developed
and strengthened your PMA until life is bringing you every
worthwhile wish. But if you haven't, you can and will learn the
techniques whereby you can release your power of PMA through
its magic in your life as you continue to read this book.
A positive mental attitude, what it is, and how it may be
developed and applied, is described throughout this book. It is the
33
one essential principle of this book's Seventeen Principles for
achieving worthwhile success. Achievement is attained through
some combination of PMA with one or more of the other sixteen
success principles Master them. Begin applying each of them as
you recognize them while reading Success Through a Positive
Mental Attitude, When you make each principle a part of your
life, yours will be a positive mental attitude in its most powerful
form. And the payoff will be success, health, happiness, wealth,
or whatever definite aims you may have in life. These will be
yours — provided you don't violate the laws of Infinite
Intelligence and the rights of your fellow men. Such violations
are the most repellent forms of NMA.
In Chapter Two you will find the formula by which you may
keep your mind positive. Master that formula; apply it in all that
you do and you will be on your way to the attainment of your
every desire.
PILOT NO. 1
Thoughts to Steer By
1. Meet the most important living person! That person is you. Your
success, health, happiness, wealth depend on how you use your
invisible talisman. How will you use it? The choice is yours.
2. Your mind is your invisible talisman. The letters PMA (positive
mental attitude) are emblazoned on one side, and NMA (negative
mental attitude) on the other. These are powerful forces. PMA is
the right mental attitude for each specific occasion. It has the power to
attract the good and the beautiful. NMA repels them. It is a
negative mental attitude that robs you of all that makes life worth
living.
Self-question: "How can I develop the right mental attitude?" Be
specific.
34
3. Don't blame God for your lack of success. Like S. B. Fuller, you
can develop a burning desire to succeed. How? Keep your mind on
the things you want and off the things you don't want, How?
4. Like S. B. Fuller, read The Bible and inspirational books for a
purpose. Ask for divine guidance. Search for the
Self-question: Do you believe it's proper to ask for Divine
Guidance?
5. Every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit for those who
have PMA. Sometimes the things that seem to be adversities turn
out to be opportunities in disguise. Tom Dempsey discovered this as
a cripple.
Self-question: Will you engage in thinking time to determine how
you can turn adversities into seeds of equivalent or greater
benefits?
6. Accept the priceless gift — the joy of work. Apply the greatest value
in life: love people and serve them. Like Henry I. Kaiser, you will
attract big and generous portions of success. You can if you
develop PMA.
Self-question: Will you search to find out how you can develop
PMA as you continue to read this book?
7. Never underestimate the repellent power of a negative mental
attitude. It can prevent life's lucky breaks from benefiting you.
Self-question: PMA attracts good. How can I develop the habit
of PMA?
8. You can profit by disappointment — if it is turned into
inspirational dissatisfaction with PMA. Like Al Allen, develop
inspirational dissatisfaction. Rearrange your attitudes and convert a
failure of one day into success on another. How do you think
you can develop inspirational dissatisfaction?
35
9. Bring into reality the possibility of the improbable by acquiring
PMA. Say to yourself, as Henry Ford said to his engineers, "Keep
working!"
Self-question: Have you the courage to aim high and strive daily
to keep your goal before you?
10. Don't let your mental attitude make you a "has-been." When
you become successful and a depression or any other
unfavorable circumstance arises which causes you a loss or
defeat, act on the self-motivator: Success is achieved by those who try
and maintained by those who keep trying with PMA. This is the way to
avoid being crushed.
UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES IN SELF-MOTIVATOR FORM:
• Every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.
• Greatness  comes  to  those who  develop  a burning  desire  to
achieve high goals.
• Success is achieved and maintained by those who try and keep on
trying with PMA.
• To become an expert achiever in any human activity, it takes
practice . . . practice . . . practice.
• Man's greatest power lies in the power of prayer.

CHAPTER 2
You Can Change Your World
We now know that PMA is a positive mental attitude. And we
also know that a Positive Mental Attitude is one of the 17 success
principles. When you begin to apply a combination of these
principles with PMA in your chosen occupation or to a solution
of your personal problems, you are on the road to success. Then
you are on the right track and headed in the right direction
towards getting what you want.
To achieve anything worthwhile in life, it is imperative that you
apply PMA, regardless of what other success principles you
employ. PMA is the catalyst which makes any combination of
success principles work to attain a worthwhile end. It is NMA,
combined with some of the same principles, that is the catalyst
which results in crime or evil. And grief, disaster, tragedy — sin,
disease, death — are some of its rewards.
17 success principles. The authors have for many years given
lectures, instructed classes, and conducted a correspondence
course on the 17 success principles. The title of the course: PMA,
The Science of Success. These 17 principles are:
1. A Positive Mental Attitude
2. Definiteness of purpose
3. Going the extra mile
4. Accurate thinking
5. Self-discipline
6. The master mind
7. Applied faith
8. A pleasing personality
9. Personal initiative
10. Enthusiasm
11. Controlled attention
12. Teamwork
13. Learning from defeat
14. Creative vision
15. Budgeting time and money
16. Maintaining sound physical
and mental health
17. Using   cosmic   habit force
(universal law)
37
These 17 success principles are no creation of the authors. They
were extracted from the lifetime experiences of hundreds of the
most successful persons our nation has known during the past
century.
As long as you live, from this day forward, you can analyze your
every success and every failure — that is, if you imprint these 17
principles indelibly in your memory.
You may develop and maintain a permanent Positive Mental
Attitude by making it your responsibility to adopt and apply these
17 principles in your daily living.
There is no other known method by which you may keep your
mind positive.
Analyze yourself courageously, now, and learn which of these 17
principles you have been using and which of them you have been
neglecting.
In the future analyze both your successes and your allures, using
the 17 principles as a measuring device, and very soon you will
be able to lay your finger on what has been holding you back.
If you have PMA and don't succeed, then what? If you use PMA
and don't succeed, it may be because you are not using each of
the principles that are necessary in the combination for success to
attain your specific goal.
You may wish to check the stories of S. B. Fuller, Tom Dempsey,
Henry J. Kaiser, the woodcutter, Al Allen, and Henry Ford, to
recognize which of the 17 success principles each person applied
or neglected to apply. You might analyze someone you know
who is a has-been in real life. As you read the case histories in the
chapters which follow, do the same thing. Ask yourself: Which of
38
the 17 success principles are used? Which are omitted? At first it
may be difficult to understand and apply the principles. But as
you continue to read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude,
each of these principles will become more clear to you. You will
then be able to use them. When you get to Chapter 20, you will
be able to check yourself accurately by the 17 success principles.
There you will find a self-analysis chart under the heading
"Success Quotient Analysis."
Has the world given you a raw deal? The students who have
enrolled in the PMA Science of Success course have often been
people who considered themselves failures in some area of their
lives. The very first question such a person might be asked when
he enters the class is: Why? Why are you taking this course? Why
haven't you had the success you would like to have? And the
reasons which they give tell us a tragic story about the causes of
failure.
"I never really had a chance to get ahead. My father was an
alcoholic, you know."
"I was raised in the slums and that's something you can never get
out of your system."
"I only had a grammar school education."
These people are all saying, in essence, that the world has given
them a raw deal. They are blaming the world and circumstances
outside themselves for their failures. They blame their heredity or
their environment. They start out with a negative mental attitude.
And, of course, with that attitude, they are handicapped But it is
NMA that is holding them down, not the external handicap which
they give as the cause of their failure.
39
A lesson learned from a child. There is a wonderful little story
about a minister who, one Saturday morning, was trying to
prepare his sermon under difficult conditions. His wife was out
shopping. It was a rainy day and his young son was restless and
bored, with nothing to do. Finally, in desperation, the minister
picked up an old magazine and thumbed through it until he came
to a large brightly colored picture. It showed a map of the world.
He tore the page from the magazine, ripped it into little bits and
threw the scraps all over the living room floor with the words:
"Johnny, if you can put this all together, I'll give you a quarter".
The preacher thought this would take Johnny most of the
morning. But within ten minutes there was a knock on his study
door. It was his son with the completed puzzle. The minister was
amazed to see Johnny finished so soon, with the pieces of paper
neatly arranged and the nap of the world back in order. 'Son, how
did you get that done so fast?" the preacher asked.
"Oh," said Johnny, "it was easy. On the other side, there was a
picture of a man. I just put a piece of paper on the bottom, put the
picture of the man together, put a piece of paper on top, and then
turned it over. I figured that if got the man right, the world would
be right."
The minister smiled, and handed his son a quarter. "And you've
given me my sermon for tomorrow, too," he said. "If a man is
right, his world will be right."
There's a great lesson in this idea. If you are unhappy with your
world and want to change it, the place to start is with yourself. If
you are right, your world will be right. This is what PMA is all
about. When you have a Positive Mental Attitude, the problems
of your world tend to bow before you.
40
You were born a champion. Have you ever thought about the
battles you won before you were born? "Stop and think about
yourself," says Amram Scheinfeld, an expert on genetics. "In all
the history of the world there was never anyone else exactly like
you, and in all the infinity of time to come, there will never be
another."
You are a very special person. And many struggles took place
that had to be successfully concluded in order to produce you.
Just think: tens of millions of sperm cells participated in a great
battle, yet only one of them won — the one that made you! It was
a great race to reach a single object: a precious egg containing a
tiny nucleus. This goal for which the sperms were competing was
smaller in size than the point of a needle. And each sperm was so
small that it would have to be magnified thousands of times
before it could be seen by the human eye. Yet it is on this
microscopic level that your life's most decisive battle was fought.
The head of each of the millions of sperms contained a precious
cargo of 24 chromosomes, just as there were 24 in the tiny
nucleus of the egg. Each chromosome was composed of jelly-like
beads closely strung together. Each bead contained hundreds of
genes to which scientists attribute all the factors of your heredity.
The chromosomes in the sperm comprised aft the hereditary
material and tendencies contributed by your father and his
ancestors; those in the egg-nucleus the inheritable traits of your
mother and her ancestors. Your mother and father themselves
represented the culmination of over two billion years of victory in
the battle to survive. And then one particular sperm — the fastest,
the healthiest, the winner — united with the waiting egg to form
one, tiny living cell.
The life of the most important living person had begun. You had
become a champion over the most staggering odds you will ever
41
have to face. For all practical purpose you had inherited from the
vast reservoir of the past all the potential abilities and powers you
need to achieve you objectives.
You were born to be a champion, and no matter what obstacles
and difficulties lie in your way, they are not one tenth so great as
the ones that have already been overcome at the moment of your
conception. Victory is built in to every living person. Take the
case of Irving Ben Cooper who was one of America's most
respected judges. But this was very far from the way young Ben
Cooper thought of himself as a young boy.
How a frightened boy developed PMA. Ben grew up in a near-
slum neighborhood in St. Joseph, Missouri. His father was an
immigrant tailor who earned little money. Many days there
simply wasn't enough to eat. To heal their small home, Ben used
to take a coal scuttle, and walk down to the railroad tracks that
ran nearby. There he would pick up pieces of coal. It embarrassed
Ben to have to do it. He'd often try to sneak through the bad
streets so children from school wouldn't see him.
But they often did. There was one gang of boys in particular who
found great sport in ambushing Ben on his way home from the
tracks and beating him up. They would scatter his coal all over
the street and send him home with tears streaming from his eyes.
Thus it was that Ben lived in a more or less permanent state of
fear and self-despising.
Something happened, as it always must when we break the
pattern of defeat. The victory within us does not assert itself until
we are ready. Ben was inspired to positive action because he read
a book. It was Robert Coverdale 's Struggle by Horatio Alger.
42
In it Ben read the adventures of a youngster like himself who was
faced with great odds, but who overcame these odds with the
courage and moral strength which Ben wished to possess.
The boy read every one of the Horatio Alger books he could
borrow. As he read, he lived the part of the hero. All winter he sat
in the cold kitchen reading stories of courage and success,
unconsciously absorbing a Positive Mental Attitude.
Some months after he had read his first Horatio Alger book, Ben
Cooper was again making a trip down to the railroad tracks. Off
in the distance he saw three figures dart behind a building. His
first thought was to turn and run. Then he remembered the
courage that he had admired in his book heroes, and, instead of
turning, his hand gripped the coal scuttle more tightly and he
marched straight ahead, as if he were one of the Alger heroes.
It was a brutal fight. The three boys jumped Ben all at the same
time. His bucket dropped, and he started flailing his arms with a
determination that caught the bullies by surprise. Ben's right hand
smashed into the lips and nose of one of the boys — his left hand
into his stomach. To Ben's surprise, the boy stopped fighting and
turned and ran. Meanwhile the other two boys were hitting and
kicking him. Ben managed to push one boy away and knock the
other down. He jumped on the second boy with his knees, while
he plowed punch after punch into his stomach and jaw — as if he
were mad. Now there was just one boy left. This was the leader.
He had jumped on top of Ben. Ben managed to pull him aside
and get on his feet. For a second the two boys stood and looked
each other squarely in the eyes.
And then, bit by bit, the leader stepped backwards. He, too, ran
away. Perhaps it was righteous indignation, but Ben picked up a
chunk of coal and threw it at the retreater.
43
It wasn't until then that Ben realized that his nose was bleeding
and that he had black and blue marks on his body from the
punches and kicks he had received. It was worth it! It was a great
day in Ben's life. In that moment he overcame fear.
Ben Cooper wasn't much stronger than he had been a year earlier.
His attackers were no less tough. The difference came in Ben's
own mental attitude. He had faced danger in spite of fear. He
decided that no longer was he going to be pushed around by
bullies. From now on, he himself was going to change his world.
And, of course, this is exactly what he did.
Identify yourself with a successful image. The boy gave himself
an identity. When he fought the three bullies on the street that
day, he was not lighting as frightened, undernourished Ben
Cooper. He was fighting as Robert Coverdale or any other of the
plucky and daring heroes of Horatio Alger's books.
Identifying one's self with a successful image can help break the
habits of self-doubt and defeat which years of NMA set up within
a personality. Another and equally important successful technique
for changing your world is to identify yourself with an image that
will inspire you to make the right decisions. It can be a slogan, a
picture, or any other symbol that is meaningful to you.
What will your picture say to you? The president of a midwest
concern operating internationally was visiting his San Francisco
office. He noticed a large photograph of himself on the wall of
the office of Dorothy Jones, a private secretary. "Dotti, that's a
rather large picture for this size room, isn't it?" he asked.
Dorothy responded, "When I have a problem, do you know what
I do?" Without waiting for an answer, she demonstrated by
placing her elbows on her desk, propping her head on the fingers
44
of her folded hands, and looking up at the picture. "Boss, how the
heck would you solve this problem?" she asked.
Dotti's remarks seem rather humorous. Yet the essence of her
idea is startling. Perhaps you have a picture in your office, your
home, or in your wallet, that could give you the right answer to
an important question in your life. Yours may be a picture of your
mother, father, wife, husband — of Benjamin Franklin or
Abraham Lincoln. It may be that of a saint.
What will your picture say to you? There is one way to find out.
When you are faced with a serious problem or decision, ask your
picture a question. Listen, for the answer.
Another essential ingredient for changing your world is to have
definiteness of purpose, one of the 17 principles of success.
Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all
achievement. Definiteness of purpose, combined with PMA, is
the starting point of all worthwhile achievement Remember —
your world will change whether or not you choose to change it.
But you have the power to choose its direction. You can select
your own targets. When you determine your definite major aims
with PMA, there is a natural tendency for you to use seven of the
success principles:
(a) Personal initiative
(b) Self-discipline
(c) Creative vision
(d) Organized thinking
(e) Controlled attention (concentration of effort)
(f) Budgeting of time and money
(g) Enthusiasm
Robert Christopher had definiteness of purpose with PMA.
45
Now, let's see how the natural tendencies for these additional
principles manifested themselves in this success story. For, like
many boys, Bob's imagination was stimulated while he read Jules
Verne's thrilling, imaginative story Around the World in 80 Days.
Bob told us:
"I used to daydream a great deal but when I grew older, I read
two books on motivation: Think and Grow Rich and The Magic of
Believing.
"Around the world in 80 days. Now, why couldn't I go around the
world on $80.00? I believed that any given aim could be
accomplished if I had faith and confidence that it could be. That
is: if I started from where I was to get to where I wanted to be.
"I thought: 'Others had worked on freighters to earn their
transatlantic passages and hitchhiked all over the world, so why
couldn't I?'"
And then Bob took his fountain pen from his pocket and wrote on
a piece of note paper a list of the problems with which he would
be faced. Also, he made notes of what he thought were workable
answers to each.
Now Bob Christopher was an expert photographer and he did
have a camera. It was a good one at that. When he reached his
decision, he went into action:
(a) Entered a contract with Charles Pfizer Company, a large
pharmaceutical company, to collect soil samples from the
various countries he intended to visit.
(b) Obtained an international driver's license and a set of
maps in return for a promised report on Middle East road
conditions.
46
(c) Picked up seamen's papers.
(d) Obtained a letter from the New York City Police
Department to prove that he had no criminal record.
(e) Arranged for a Youth Hostel Membership.
(f) Contacted a freight airline which agreed to transport him
by plane over the Atlantic on his promise to obtain
photographs which the company intended to use for
publicity.
And when his plans were completed, this young man of 26 left
New York City by plane with $80.00 in his pocket Around the
world on $80.00 was his definite major aim. And here are a few
of his experiences:
• Had breakfast at Gander, Newfoundland. How did he pay
for it? He photographed the cooks in the kitchen. And they
were pleased.
• Bought four cartons of American cigarettes at Shannon,
Ireland that cost him $4.80. At that time cigarettes were as
good as money as a medium of exchange in many countries.
• Arrived at Vienna from Paris. The fee — one carton of
cigarettes to the driver.
• Gave the conductor four packs of cigarettes to take him
from Vienna to Switzerland on a train through the Alps.
• Rode a bus to Damascus. A policeman In Syria was so
proud of the picture that Bob had taken of him that he
ordered the bus driver to take him.
47
• Took a photograph of the president and staff of the Iraq
Express Transportation Company. This earned him a ride
from Baghdad to Teheran.
• In Bangkok, the owner of a very fine restaurant fed him like
a king. For Bob gave him the information he wanted — a
detailed description of a specific area and a set of maps.
• Was brought from Japan to San Francisco as a crew member
of S.S. The Flying Spray.
Around the world in 80 days? No — Robert Christopher went
around the world in 84 days. But he did accomplish his objective.
He went around the world on $80.00
And because he had definiteness of purpose with PMA, he was
automatically motivated to use an additional 13 of the 17 success
principles to achieve his specific goal.
The starting point of all achievement. Let us repeat: The
starting point of all achievement is definiteness of purpose with
PMA. Remember this statement and ask yourself, what is my
goal? What do I really want?
Based on the people we see in our PMA Science of Success
course, we estimate that 98 out of every 100 persons who are
dissatisfied with their world do not have a clear picture in their
minds of the world they would like for themselves.
Think of it! Think of the people who drift aimlessly through life,
dissatisfied, struggling against a great many things, but without a
clear-cut goal. Can you state, right now, what it is that you want
out of life? Fixing your goals may not be easy. It may even
involve some painful self-examination. But it will be worth
whatever effort it costs, because as soon as you can name your
48
goal, you can expect to enjoy many advantages. These
advantages come almost automatically.
1. The first great advantage is that your subconscious mind
begins to work under a universal law: "What the mind of
man can conceive and believe — the mind of man can
achieve with PMA." Because you visualize your intended
destination, your subconscious mind is affected by this
self-suggestion. It goes to work to help you get there.
2. Because you know what you want, there is a tendency for
you to try to get on the right track and head in the right
direction. You get into action.
3. Work now becomes fun. You are motivated to pay the
price. You budget your time and money. You study, think,
and plan. The more you think about your goals, the more
enthusiastic you become. And with enthusiasm your desire
turns into a burning desire.
4. You become alerted to opportunities that will help you
achieve your objectives as they present themselves in your
everyday experiences. Because you know what you want,
you are more likely to recognize these opportunities.
These four advantages are illustrated by an early experience of
the man who was later to become editor of the Ladies Home
Journal. Edward Bok came from Holland as a boy with his
parents. He was imbued with the idea that some day he was going
to run a magazine. With this specific goal before him, he was able
to seize upon an incident so trivial that with most of us it would
have passed unnoticed.
He saw a man open a package of cigarettes, take a slip of paper
from it, and drop the paper on the floor. Bok stooped and picked
49
up the scrap of paper. On it was a picture of a famous actress.
Below the picture was a statement that this was one of a series.
The cigarette buyer was urged to collect the complete set of
pictures. Bok turned the piece of paper over and noticed that the
back side was perfectly blank.
Bok's mind, filled as it was with a purpose, sensed an opportunity
here. He reasoned that the value of the picture enclosed in the
package of cigarettes would be greatly enhanced if the blank side
were devoted to a brief biography of the person pictured. He went
to the lithograph firm, which printed the enclosure and explained
his idea to the manager. The manager promptly said:
I'll give you ten dollars each if you will write me a 100-word
biography of 100 famous Americans. Send me a list, and group
them — you know: presidents, famous soldiers, actors, authors,
and so on."
This is the way Edward Bok got his first literary assignment. The
demand for his short biographies became so great that he needed
help, so he offered his brother five dollars each if he would help
him. Before long, Bok had five journalists busy turning out
biographies for the lithograph presses. Bok — he was the editor!
You have success born in you. Notice that none of the men we
have been talking about had success handed to him on a platter.
At first the world was not particularly kind to Edward Bok or
Judge Cooper. And yet each carved from the raw material around
him a career of great satisfaction. And each one did it by
developing the many talents he found within himself.
Everyone has many talents for surmounting his special
problems. It is interesting to note that life never leaves us
stranded. If life hands us a problem, it hands us also the abilities
with which to meet the problem. Our abilities vary, of course, as
50
we are motivated to use them. And even though you are in ill
health, you can nonetheless lead a useful and happy life.
You may fear ill health is too great a handicap to overcome. If
this is true, take courage from the experience of Milo C. Jones.
Milo had not tried to acquire wealth when he had good health.
And then he became sick. When he became sick, the odds were
stacked heavily against him.
Here's the story of his experience.
When Milo C. Jones had been in good health he had worked very
hard. He was a farmer and he operated a small farm near Fort
Atkinson, Wisconsin. But somehow he seemed unable to make
his farm yield much more than the bare necessities for himself
and his family. This kind of existence went on year after year.
Then suddenly something happened!
Jones was stricken with extensive paralysis and confined to his
bed. Here was a man who late in life became completely
incapacitated. He was barely able to move his body. His relatives
were certain he would be permanently unhappy as a hopeless
invalid. And he would have been had not something more
happened to him. And he made it happen. It brought the kind of
happiness to him that comes with achievement and financial
success.
What was it Jones used to bring about this change? He used his
mind. Yes, his body was paralyzed. But his mind was unaffected.
He could think and he did think and plan. One day while engaged
in thinking and planning, he recognized the most important living
person with the magic talisman with PMA on one side and NMA
on the other. He saw clearly that he was a mind with a body. He
made his own decision right then and there!
51
PMA attracts wealth. Milo C. Jones chose to develop a positive
mental attitude. He chose to be hopeful, optimistic, happy and to
convert creative thinking into reality by starting right from where
he was. He wanted to be useful. And be wanted to support his
family, instead of being a burden to them. But how could he turn
his disadvantage into advantage? He didn't let this vital problem
stop him. He found the answer.
First, Jones counted his blessings. He discovered that he had so
very much for which to be thankful. This thankfulness led him to
search for additional blessings which he might enjoy in the
future. And because he was searching for, among other things, a
way to be useful, he found and recognized that for which he was
looking. It was a plan and it required action.
So Jones went into mental action.
He revealed the plan to members of his family.
"I am no longer able to work with my hands," he began, "so I
have decided to work with my mind. Every one of you can, if you
will, take the place of my hands, feet, and physical body. Let's
plant every tillable acre of out farm in corn. Then let's raise pigs
and feed them the corn. Let's slaughter the pigs while they are
young and tender and convert them into sausages. And then we
can package and sell them under a brand name. We'll sell them in
retail stores all over the country." And then he chuckled as he
said:
"They'll sell like hot cakes!"
And they did sell like hot cakes! In a few years the brand name
"Jones" Little Pig Sausages" became a household byword. And
these four words became a symbol that tantalized the appetites of
men, women, and children throughout the nation.
52
And Milo C. Jones lived to see himself a millionaire. He had
achieved something even more through a positive mental attitude.
For he bad flipped his talisman to PMA. And thus although he
was physically handicapped, he became a happy man.
He was happy because he was useful.
A formula to help you change your world. Fortunately not every
life is faced with such great difficulties. Yet everyone has
problems. And everyone reacts to motivating symbols through
suggestion or self-suggestion. A most effective form is a self-
motivator deliberately memorized for the purpose of flashing
from the subconscious to the conscious in time of need.
What, then, is a formula that can help you change your world?
Memorize, understand, and repeat frequently throughout the day:
What the mind of man can conceive and believe, the mind of man
can achieve with PMA. It is a form of self-suggestion. It is a self-
motivator to success. When it becomes a part of you, you dare to
aim higher.
Bill was a sickly farm boy in the southeastern Missouri country.
A dedicated grammar school teacher motivated young William
Danforth to change his world. The teacher did this with a
challenge: / Dare You! "I dare you to become the healthiest boy
in school!" / Dare You! became William Danforth's self-
motivator throughout life.
He became the healthiest boy in his school. Before he died at the
age of 85, he helped thousands of other youths develop good
health — and something more: to aspire nobly, to adventure
daringly, and to serve humbly. During his long career be never
lost a day at work because of illness.
53
/ Dare You! motivated him to build one of America's largest
corporations. The Ralston Purina Company. / Dare You!
motivated him to engage in creative thinking and turn liabilities
into assets. I Dare You! motivated him to organize The American
Youth Foundation: its purpose is to train young men and women
in Christian ideals and to prepare them for the responsibilities of
life.
/ Dare You! motivated William Danforth to write a book entitled
/ Dare You! Today this book is inspiring boys and girls, men and
women, to have the courage to make this world a better world to
live in.
What a remarkable testimony to the power of a self-motivator to
develop a positive mental attitude!
Are you, yourself, ever tempted to blame the world for your
failures? If so, pause and reconsider. Does the problem lie with
the world, or with you? Dare to learn the 17 success principles!
Dare to memorize self-motivators! Dare to apply them with the
full assurance that they will work for you just as effectively as
they are working every day for hundreds of others.
Perhaps you don't know how. Perhaps you need to learn to think
mere accurately. Be guided by Pilot No. 2.
Then turn to Chapter Three. Its purpose is to help you — clear the
cobwebs from your thinking.
PILOT NO. 2
Thoughts to Steer By
1.   You can change your world! To achieve anything worthwhile
in life it is necessary to set high goals for yourself and want to
54
achieve them. Have you thought about the high goals you
would like to achieve?
2. Imprint the 17 success principles indelibly in your memory.
Have you memorized them?
3. Do you tend to "blame the world"? If you do, memorize the
self-motivator: If the man is right, his world will be right. Is
your immediate world right?
4. You were born to be a champion. For all practical purposes,
you have inherited from the vast reservoir of the past all the
potential abilities and powers you need to achieve your
objectives. Are you willing to pay the price to develop your
abilities and use the powers within you?
5. Identify yourself with a successful image, as Irving Ben
Cooper did. Who will you select?
6. Ask yourself an important question: What will your picture say
to you? Listen for the answer.
7. Definiteness of purpose with PMA is the starting point of all
worthwhile achievement. Have you selected some definite,
specific, desirable goal? Will you keep it in mind daily?
8. When you determine your definite aims, there is a tendency for
several additional success principles to begin to operate
automatically to help you achieve them.
9. Everyone has many talents for surmounting his special
problems. What special talents do you think you have that you
can develop?
55
10. Here is a formula that has helped many to change their world:
What the mind of man can conceive and believe the mind of
man can achieve with PMA. Have you memorized this
formula?
A POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE AND
DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE IS THE
STARTING POINT TOWARD ALL
WORTHWHILE ACHIEVEMENT!

CHAPTER 3
Clear the Cobwebs from Your Thinking
You are what you think. But what do you think? How orderly are
your thought processes? How straight is your thinking?
And how clean are your thoughts?
There are certain mental cobwebs that clutter up the thinking of
almost everyone, even the most brilliant minds. Negative:
feelings, emotions, passions — habits, beliefs and prejudices. Our
thoughts become entangled in these webs.
Sometimes we have undesirable habits and we want to correct
them. And there are times when we are strongly tempted to do
wrong. Then, like an insect caught in a spider's web, we struggle
to get free. Our conscious will is in conflict with our imagination
and the will of our subconscious mind. The more we struggle, the
more we become entrapped.
Some persons give up and experience the mental conflicts of a
living hell. Others learn how to tap and use the powers of the
subconscious through the conscious mind. They are victorious.
And success through a positive mental attitude teaches you how
to tap and use these powers.
An insect may not be able to avoid being caught in the spider's
web. And when once trapped, it is unable to free itself. There is
one thing, however, over which each person has absolute,
inherent control, and that is his mental attitude. We can avoid
mental cobwebs. We can clear them. And we can sweep them
away as they begin to develop. We can free ourselves when once
enmeshed. And we can remain free.
57
You do this by accurate thinking with PMA. Accurate thinking is
one of the 17 success principles revealed in Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude.
To think accurately you must use reason. The science of
reasoning or accurate thinking is called logic. One can learn it
from books written specifically on this subject, such as: The Art
of Clear Thinking, by Rudolf Flesch; Your Most Enchanted
Listener, by Wendell Johnson; Introduction to Logic, by Irving
Copi; and The Art of Straight Thinking, by Edwin Leavitt Clarke.
These books can be of immense practical help.
But we don't act from reason alone. And action based on
common sense is the result of more than just reason. It depends
upon habits of thought and action, intuitions, experiences and
other influences such as tendencies and environment.
One of the cobwebs of our thinking is to assume that we act from
reason alone when in reality every conscious act is the result of
doing what we want to do. We make decisions. There is a
tendency, when reasoning, to draw conclusions favorable to the
strong inner urges of our subconscious mind. And this tendency
exists in everyone — even the great thinkers and philosophers.
In 31 B.C. a Greek philosopher who lived in a city on the Aegean
Sea wanted to go to Carthage. He was a teacher of logic;
therefore be contemplated reasons in favor of making the voyage
and reasons against it. For every reason as to why he should go
he found that there were many more reasons why he shouldn't. Of
course he would be seasick. The boat was so small that a storm
might jeopardize his life. Pirates with swift sailing vessels were
lying in wait off Tripoli to prey upon merchant vessels. If his ship
were captured by them, they would take his worldly goods and
sell him into slavery. Discretion indicated that he should not
make the trip.
58
But he did. Why? Because he wanted to.
It so happens that emotion and reason should be in balance in
everyone's life. Neither should always hold the controlling hand.
So sometimes it is good to do what you want to do instead of
what reason fears. As to this philosopher — he had a most
pleasant journey and arrived back home safely.
Then there was Socrates, the great Athenian philosopher who
lived from 470 B.C. to 399 B.C. He has gone down in history as
one of the outstanding thinkers of all time. Wise as Socrates was,
there were cobwebs in his thinking too.
As a young man Socrates fell in love with Xanthippe. She was
very beautiful. He wasn't good looking, but he was persuasive.
Persuasive individuals seem to have the ability to get what they
want. Socrates was successful in persuading Xanthippe to marry
him.
Are you seeing only the mote in the other fellow's eye? After
the honeymoon was over, things didn't go along so well at his
house. His wife began to see his faults. And he saw hers. He was
motivated by egoism. He was selfish. She was always nagging
him. Socrates reportedly said, "My aim in life is to get on well
with people. I chose Xanthippe because I knew if I could get on
well with her, I could get along with anyone."
That is what he said. But his actions disproved his words. It is
questionable that he tried to get on well with more than a few.
When you always try to prove to persons whom you meet that
they are wrong, you repel rather than attract as Socrates did.
Yet he said that he endured Xanthippe's nagging for his own
personal self-discipline. But he would have developed real self-
discipline had he tried to understand his wife and to influence her
59
through the same considerate attentions and expressions of love
that he used in persuading her to marry him. He didn't see the
beam in his own eye, but he saw the mote in Xanthippe's eye.
Of course, Xanthippe wasn't blameless either. Socrates and she
were just like many husbands and wives living today. After their
marriage they neglect to continue to communicate their true
feelings of affection, understanding, and love to each other. They
neglect to continue to employ the same pleasing personalities and
mental attitudes that made their courtship such a happy
experience. Negligence is a cobweb too.
Now Socrates didn't read Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude. Neither did Xanthippe. Had she done so, she would have
known how to motivate her husband so that their home life would
have been a happier one. She would have seen the beam in her
eye, rather than the mote in Socrates'. She would have controlled
her own reactions and been sensitive to the reactions of her
husband. In fact, she might have even proved the fallacy of his
logic after she read Chapter Five entitled "... And Something
More."
And because the story of Socrates proves he saw only mote in
Xanthippe's eye we shall tell you about another young man — he
learned to see the beam in his own eye. But before we do, let's
see how the habit of nagging develops.
You see, when you know the cause of a problem, you can often
avoid it or you can find your own solution to that problem if you
already have it.
S. I. Hayakawa in Language in Thought and Action wrote:
In order to cure (what she believes to be) her husband's
faults, a wife may nag him. His faults get worse, so she
60
nags him some more. Naturally his faults get worse still,
and she nags him even more. Governed by a fixated
reaction to the problem of her husband's faults, she can
meet it only one way. The longer she continues, the worse
it gets, until they are both nervous wrecks; their marriage
is destroyed, and their lives are shattered.
Now what about the young man? It was the first evening of a
PMA Science of Success class when he was asked, "Why are you
taking this course?"
"Because of my wife!" he responded. Many of the students
laughed — but not the instructor. He knew from experience that
there are many unhappy homes when husband or wife sees the
other's faults but not his or her own.
He restored happiness to his home. It was four weeks later in a
private conference that the instructor asked the student, "How are
you coming along with your problem?"
"It's solved!"
'That's wonderful! But how did you solve it?"
"I learned: when 1 am faced with a problem that involves
misunderstandings with other persons, I must first start with
myself When I examined my own mental attitude, I discovered
that it was negative. My problem was really not with my wife
after all — it was with me! In solving my problem I found that I
no longer had one will her."
Now, what if Socrates had said to himself: "When I am faced
with a problem that involves a misunderstanding with Xanthippe,
I must first start with myself"? And what would happen if you
would say to yourself: "When I am faced with a problem that
61
involves a misunderstanding with another person, I must first start
with myself? Would you life be a happier one?
But there are many other cobwebs that interfere with happiness.
Oddly enough, the one that is the greatest hindrance is the very
tool of thought itself: words. Words art symbols, as S. I.
Hayakawa tells us in his book. And you, will find that a one-word
symbol can mean to you the sum total of a combination of
innumerable ideas, concept, and experiences. And you will also
see as you continue to read Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude that the subconscious instantaneously communicates to
the conscious mind through symbols.
Through one word you can motivate others to act. When you say
to another person "You can!" this is suggestion. When you say to
yourself "I can!" you motivate yourself by self-suggestion. But
more about these universal truths in the next chapter. First let's
recognize that a whole science has grown up around the
important discoveries made about words and the communicating
of ideas through words: the science of semantics.
And Hayakawa is an expert in this field. He tells us that to find
out what a word really means on the lips of another person, or
even on your own lips, is essential in the process of accurate
thinking.
But how does one do this?
Just be specific. Start with a meeting of the minds and many
needless misunderstandings will be avoided.
One word can cause an argument. The uncle of a nine-year-old
boy was visiting in the home of the boy's parents. One evening
when the father came home, the following dialogue developed:
62
"What do you think of a boy that lies?"
"I don't think very much of him, and I know one thing certain: my
son tells the truth,"
"He told a lie today."
"Son, did you tell your uncle a lie?"
"No, father."
"Let's clear this thing up. Your uncle says you lied. You say you
didn't. Just exactly what did happen?" he asked, turning to the
uncle.
"Well, I told him to take his toys down to the basement. He didn't
do it, and he told me that he did."
"Son, did you take your toys to the basement?"
"Yes, father."
"Son, how do you explain this? Your uncle says that you didn't
take your toys to the basement and you say that you did."
"There are several steps leading from the first floor down to the
basement... About four steps down is a window... I put my toys
on the window sill... The basement is the distance between the
floor and the ceiling... My toys are in the basement!"
The argument between the uncle and his nephew was due to the
definition of one word: basement. The boy probably knew what
his uncle meant, but he was lazy and hadn't wanted to run all the
way downstairs. When he was faced with punishment, the boy
tried to save himself by using logic to prove his point.
63
Now this may be intriguing. But more motivating will be the
story of a young man who didn't know what the most important
word symbol in any language means. And what is the most
important word in any language? That word is God.
Not so long ago a student from Columbia University called on the
Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick, Minister Emeritus of The Riverside
Church of New York City. The student had hardly gotten through
the door before he said:
"I am an atheist!" When he sat down, he repeated defiantly, "I
don't believe in God."
Let's start with a meeting of the minds. Now, fortunately, Dr.
Fosdick was also an expert in the field of semantics. He knew
from long experience that he could never really communicate
with another person unless he understood exactly what that other
person meant by the words he used. He also knew that it was
necessary for the other person to comprehend his meaning. So
instead of taking offense at the student's brash remark, Dr.
Fosdick expressed a genuinely friendly interest in him and then
asked, "Please describe to me the God you do not believe in."
The young man had to think, as everyone has to thick when he is
asked a question that doesn't cause a reflex "yes" or "no" answer.
Dr. Fosdick knew that the right question could sweep strong
cobwebs of negative thinking out of the youth's mind.
After a little while the student began to try to describe the God he
didn't believe in. In so doing he gave the minister a very clear
picture of the God he rejected.
"Well," said Dr. Fosdick when the student had finished, "if that is
the God you don't believe in, I don't believe in him either. So we
are both atheists. Nevertheless," he continued, "we still have the
64
universe on our hands. What do you make of it — its formation,
its meaning?"
Before the young man left Dr. Fosdick, he discovered that he was
not an atheist at all, but a very good theist. He did believe in God.
Now Dr. Fosdick had not been thrown by the undefined use of a
word. In this instance he helped sweep away the cobwebs of the
young man's thinking by asking him questions. The simple, clear
response as to what the young man didn't believe in was enough
to allow a meeting of the minds. The second question directed the
youth's thoughts into the proper channels. And it gave Dr.
Fosdick an opportunity to explain his meaning of the universal
God.
Frog legs taught him logic. As we have seen, the student
reached two entirely different conclusions. Each was based on a
different premise. Cobwebs will interfere with accurate thinking
and cause you to reach a wrong conclusion when you start with a
false premise. W. Clement Stone had an amusing experience with
this which he describes as follows:
As a boy I enjoyed eating frog legs. One day at a
restaurant I was served jumbo frog legs and didn't like
them. Then and there I decided that I didn't like large
frog legs.
Some years later I was at a quality restaurant in Louisville,
Kentucky and saw frog legs on the menu. My
conversation with the waiter was as follows:
"Are these small frog legs?"
"Yes sir!"
"Are you sure? I don't like the large ones.
65
"Yes sir!"
"If they're the small ones, that'll be fine for me."
"Yes sir!"
When the waiter brought the entree, I saw that they were
jumbo frog legs. I was irritated and said: "These aren't the
small frog legs!"
"These are the smallest we could find, sir," the waiter
responded.
Rather than be unpleasant I ate the frog legs. And I
enjoyed them, so much that I wished they had been
larger.
I learned a lesson in logic.
In analyzing the matter I realized that my conclusions
about the merits of large and small frog legs had been
based on the wrong premise. It wasn't the size of the frog
legs that made them distasteful. It was the fact that the
jumbo frog legs I had eaten the first time hadn't been
fresh. I had associated my distaste for jumbo frog legs
with size rather than with spoilage.
Now we see that cobwebs prevent accurate thinking when we
start with the wrong premise. So many persons think inaccurately
when they allow all-embracing word symbols to clutter up their
minds with false premises. Such words or expressions as: always
— only — never — nothing — every — everyone — no one —
can't — impossible — either... or — are most frequently false
premises. Consequently, when they are so used their logical
conclusions are false.
66
Necessity plus PMA can motivate you to succeed. Now there is
one word which, when used with PMA, motivates a person to
honorable achievement. When used with NMA, it becomes the
excuse for lies, deception, and fraud. Necessity is the word.
Necessity is the mother of invention and the father of crime.
Inviolable standards of integrity are fundamental to all
worthwhile achievement and are an integral part of PMA.
You will read many success stories throughout this book in which
persons are motivated by necessity. And in each case you'll find
that such persons achieved success without transgressing an
inviolable standard of integrity. Lee Braxton is such a man.
Lee Braxton, of Whiteville, North Carolina, was the son of a
struggling blacksmith. He was the tenth child in a family of
twelve. "... so you might say," says Mr. Braxton, "that I became
acquainted with poverty early in life. By hard work I managed to
get through the sixth grade in school. I shined shoes, delivered
groceries, sold news-papers, worked in a hosiery mill, washed
automobiles, and served as a mechanic's helper."
When he became a mechanic, it appeared to Lee that he r had
risen as far as he could go. Perhaps he had not yet developed
inspirational dissatisfaction. In due course he married. And
together he and his wife scrimped along. He was used to poverty.
And it now seemed to him that it was impossible for him to break
the ties which held him down, although he was poorly paid and
just barely supporting his family. The Braxtons were already
having a terrible time making ends meet when, to complete the
picture of defeat, he lost his job. His home was about to be taken
from him because he was unable to meet the mortgage payments.
It seemed a hopeless situation.
67
But Lee was a man of character. He was also a religions man.
And he believed that God is always a good God. So he prayed for
guidance. As if in answer to his prayer, he received the book
Think and Grow Rich from a friend. This friend had lost his job
and his home in the Depression. And he had been motivated to
recoup his fortune after reading Think and Grow Rich.
Now Lee was ready.
He read the book again and again. He was searching for financial
success. He said to himself: "It seems to me there is something I
have to do. I have to add something, No book will do it for me.
The first thing I must do is develop a Positive Mental Attitude
regarding my abilities and my opportunities. I must certainly
choose a definite goal. When I do, I must aim higher than I have
in the past. But I must get started. I'll begin with the first job I can
find."
And he looked for a job and found one. It didn't pay much to
start.
But it wasn't many years after he had read Think and Grow Rich
that Lee Braxton organized and became president of the First
National Bank of Whiteville, was elected mayor of his city, and
engaged in many successful business enterprises. You see: Lee
had aimed high — in fact, very high. He had taken as his major
purpose the goal of being rich enough to retire at the age of 50.
He achieved this goal six years ahead of time — retiring from
active business with substantial wealth and a fine independent
income at the age of 44. Today Lee Braxton is leading a useful
life. He is devoting his entire efforts to helping Oral Roberts, the
evangelist, in his ministry.
Now, the jobs that he took and the investments he made in
climbing from failure to success are not important here. What is
68
important is that necessity motivates a man with PMA to action
without transgressing recognized inviolable standards. An honest
man won't deceive, cheat, or steal because of necessity. Honesty
is inherent in PMA.
Necessity, NMA and crime. Now, contrast such a man with the
many thousands of persons with NMA who are imprisoned
because of stealing, embezzling, or other crimes. When you ask
them why they stole in the first place, their answer invariably is:
"I had to." And that's how they landed in prison! They allowed
themselves to become dishonest because cobwebs in their
thinking caused them to believe that necessity forces one to
become dishonest.
Some years ago, Napoleon Hill, while doing personal counseling
in the prison library in the federal penitentiary at Atlanta, had
several confidential talks with Al Capone. In one of these talks,
the author inquired: "How did you get started in a life of crime?"
Capone answered with one word: "Necessity."
Then tears came into his eyes and he choked up. He began to tell
of some of the good things he had done which the newspapers
had never mentioned. Of course, these seem insignificant
compared to the evil that is attributed to his name.
That unfortunate man wasted his life, destroyed his peace of
mind, undermined his physical body with deadly disease, and
spread fear and disaster in the path he followed — all because he
never learned to clear the cobwebs of his thinking regarding
necessity.
And when Capone told of his good deeds, which he implied
offset to some great degree the wrongs he had done, he clearly
indicated   another  cobweb  which  was  preventing  him  from
69
thinking accurately. While a man can neutralize the evil he has
done by true repentance followed by a life of good deeds, Capone
was not such a man.
But there was such a man. He was a teen-age problem child. Yet
his mother never lost hope even though many of her specific
prayers for him seemed unanswered. And she never lost faith,
regardless of her son's escapades or wrongdoing.
He was a teen-age problem child. This young man became an
educated, intellectual, passionate, and sensual teen-age problem
child. He took pride in being first, even in evil. It is said that he
disobeyed his parents and teachers, lied and deceived, committed
petty thefts, cheated in gambling, indulged in alcoholic and
sexual excesses.
Yet because of his mother's constant and earnest picas to him to
mend his ways, he struggled to find himself even before he
reached the lowest point in his moral life. Sometimes he was
filled with shame by the knowledge that men with less education
were able to resist temptations which he thought he was
powerless to resist. And because he was educated, and because he
was searching, he studied the Bible and other inspirational books
of his day.
Even so, he lost many battles with himself. And then one day be
won the battle that turned the tide to personal victory. This is
what happens when a person keeps trying. It was during a period
of remorse when he was overcome with self-condemnation that
he overheard a conversation in which one voice said, "Take up
and read!"
He reached for the nearest book, opened it, and read: "Let us
walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not
in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put
70
ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh,
to fulfill the lusts thereof."
It often happens. After a person suffers a serious defeat in a
personal battle with himself, he may at that point be ready. His
remorse can be so emotional and sincere that he is motivated to
take immediate action and through perseverance make the change
that keeps him on the road to j a complete victory.
Now this young man was ready!
And once he made his irrevocable decision, he had peace of
mind. He believed that Divine Power would help him overcome
the sins which he had previously fought in vain and he developed
a deep spirituality. His subsequent life proved this by results. The
young man devoted himself to God and the service of his
fellowmen.
It is because of what he had been and what he became that he is
considered a man who has had a most powerful influence in
giving hope even to the hopeless. Augustine was his name. And
he was made a saint.
It is well known that the power of the Bible has been instrumental
in changing even the attitudes of human derelicts from negative
to positive. And because of the special power in this Written
Word they were inspired to clear the cobwebs from their
thinking. Thus they became clean in thought and habit. Many,
like St. Augustine, have been moved to deep repentance and, like
him, they have been motivated to devote their lives to the service
of God and mankind. And many great evangelists climbed from
these ranks.
Now, there are some good people of strong religious faith who
also read their Bibles but say to us, "Don't try to interfere with
71
God," when we recommend other inspirational books. Cobwebs
prevent them from trying to extract the good wherever it can be
found.
You don't try to interfere with God. Now these good people fear
that it is sacrilegious to dare to explore the powers of the mind
God has given them: to choose, to plan, and to control their
future. Many books of inspiration are written to motivate the
reader to direct his thoughts, control his emotions, and ordain his
destiny. And they often help the reader to comprehend the truths
of the Bible.
This is true, for example, in such a non-fiction best seller as The
Power of Positive Thinking. In his book Norman Vincent Peale
endeavors to motivate the reader to better himself. To do so, he
quotes directly from the Good Book in which such people do
believe. Some of the quotations Dr. Peale uses (and which it
would be wise to memorize) are:
As he thinketh in his heart, so is he.
If thou  canst believe,  all things  are possible  to  him  that
believeth.
Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief!.
according to your faith be it unto you.
Faith without works is dead.
What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye
receive them, and ye shall have them.
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you.
72
You have just seen several mental cobwebs as we have pointed
them out to you. Some of these are:
1. Negative: (a) feelings, (b) emotions, (c) passions, (d)
habits, (e) beliefs and (f) prejudices.
2. Seeing only the mote in the other fellow's eye.
3. Arguments   and   misunderstandings   due  to   semantic
difficulties.
4. False conclusions resulting from false premises.
5. All-inclusive, restrictive words or expressions as basic or
minor premises.
6. The idea that necessity forces dishonesty.
7. Unclean thoughts and habits.
8. Fear that it is sacrilegious to use the powers of your
mind.
And so you see there are many varieties of cobwebs-some small,
some large, some weak, some strong. Yet if you make an
additional listing of your own, and then examine the strands of
each cobweb closely, you will find that they are all spun by
NMA.
And when you think about it for a while, you will see that the
strongest cobweb spun by NMA is the cobweb of inertia. Inertia
causes you to do nothing; or, if you are moving in the wrong
direction, keeps you from resisting or stopping. You go on and
on.
Ignorance is the result of Inertia. That which seems logical to
the person who is ignorant of the facts or know-how may be
illogical to the man who does know. When you make decisions
73
because you refuse to keep an open mind and learn the truth —
that is ignorance. And NMA keeps alive and grows fat on
ignorance. Eliminate it! Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude indicates clearly how you can eliminate it.
The man with PMA may not know the facts or have the know-
how. He may not understand. Yet he recognizes the basic premise
that truth is truth and is not false regardless of his lack of
knowledge or understanding. He therefore endeavors to keep an
open mind and to learn. He must base his conclusions on what he
does know, yet be prepared to change them when he becomes
more enlightened.
Will you dare to clear the cobwebs from your thinking? If your
answer is "yes," then let Pilot No. 3 guide you as you move
forward into Chapter Four. You will be ready to see with an open
mind. You will be ready to explore the powers of your mind. And
when you do — your exploration will lead you to a great
discovery. But only you can make it for yourself.
PILOT NO. 3
Thoughts to Steer By
1. You are what you think. Your thoughts are evaluated by
whether your attitude is positive or negative. Take a look at
yourself. Are you 1) a good person?... 2) evil?... 3) healthy?...
4) psychosomatically ill?... 5) wealthy?... 6) poor? If you are,
then 1) you have good thoughts... 2) your thoughts are evil... 3)
your thoughts are of good health... 4) your thinking makes you
so... 5) your thoughts are of riches... 6) your thoughts are of
poverty.
74
2. Negative: feelings, emotions, passions — prejudices, beliefs,
habits: you clear these mental cobwebs by turning your
talisman from NMA to PMA.
3. You can clear the mental cobwebs of negative passions,
emotions, feelings, tendencies, prejudices, beliefs and habits
by flipping your invisible talisman from NMA to PMA. You
will learn how as you respond to what you read in Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude.
4. When you are faced with a problem that involves a
misunderstanding with other persons, you must first start with
yourself.
5. One word can cause an argument, develop misunderstanding,
generate unhappiness and end in misery. One word with PMA,
when compared to the same word with NMA, brings opposite
effects. One word can bring peace or war, yes or no, love or
hate, integrity or dishonesty.
6. Let's start with a meeting of the minds. When Dr. Fosdick
brought about a meeting of the minds, the young man himself
concluded that he was not an atheist, he did believe in God.
7. Frog legs taught him logic. When you reason by inference, be
certain that your major and minor premises are correct.
8. Such all-inclusive, restrictive words as: always — only —
never — nothing — every — everyone — no one — can't —
impossible should be eliminated as premises in reasoning until
you are certain that they are correct.
9. Necessity is the word. Does necessity motivate you to high
achievement through your personal honesty and integrity, or
75
does necessity motivate you to try to get results through
deception or dishonesty?
10. A teen-age problem child: you may know one. But don't give
up hope. He may not become a saint. But someday be may
make his world and your world a better world to live in.
11. Direct your thoughts; control your emotions; and ordain your
destiny! Memorize and repeat frequently the self-motivators
quoted from the Bible on page 45.
12. Learn to separate "facts" from fiction. Then learn the
difference between important facts and un-important facts.
DIRECT YOUR THOUGHTS WITH PMA
TO CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS
AND TO ORDAIN YOUR DESTINY
76
CHAPTER 4
Will You Dare to Explore the Powers of Your Mind?
"You are a mind with a body!"
Because you are a mind, you possess mystical powers — powers
known and unknown. Dare to explore the power of your mind!
Why explore them?
When you make the discoveries that are awaiting you, they can
bring you: (1) physical, mental and moral health, happiness, and
wealth; (2) success in your chosen field of endeavor; and even (3)
a means to affect, use, control, a harmonize with powers known
and unknown.
And dare to investigate all non-physical forces lying outside the
realm of known physical processes — forces which you can use
when you learn how to apply them. And this will not be so
difficult for you — no more difficult than turning on a television
set for the first time.
For a little child can tune into his favorite television program.
Now, when he does, he neither knows the construction of the
broadcasting station or his receiving set nor the technology
involved. But that's all right. For at the child needs to know is
how to turn the right knob or push the right button.
You will see in this chapter how you can turn the right knob or
push the right button to get what you want from the most
effective electrical machine ever conceived. Although this
particular machine is the sublime handiwork of Divine Power —
you own it. How is it made? Well, among other things, it is
comprised of over 80 trillion electrical cells. Naturally, it has
77
many component parts. And each part is in itself an electrical
mechanism.
And one part is an electrical marvel. Yet it weighs only fifty
ounces. Its mechanism consists of over 10 billion cells, which
generate, receive, record, and transmit energy.
What is this wonderful machine that you own? Your body. You
are and will be the same you even though you lose an arm, an
eye, or other parts of your body.
And the electrical marvel? Your brain and your nervous system.
It is the mechanism through which your body is controlled and
through which your mind functions.
And your mind: it, too, has parts. One is known as the conscious,
and the other the subconscious. They synchronize. They work
together. Scientists have learned a great deal about the conscious
mind. Yet it has been less than a hundred years since we began to
explore the vast unknown territory of the subconscious — even
though primitive man has deliberately used the mystical powers
of the subconscious from the beginning of man's history, and
even today the Aborigines of Australia and other primitive
peoples do so to a very great extent.
Let's start exploring now!
Day by day in every way, I'm getting richer and richer! Let's
begin by accompanying Bill McCall of Sydney, Australia on a
journey from failure and defeat to success and achievement.
It was at the age of 19 that Bill started a business of his own —
hides and skins. He failed. At the age of 21, he ran for Federal
Congress. And again, he failed. Now it seems that instead of
78
crushing him, these and other defeats motivated this young
Australian to develop inspirational dissatisfaction.
So he began searching for rules of success.
You see, Bill McCall wanted to become rich, and he thought he
could find rules for acquiring wealth in inspirational books.
Therefore, while checking the inspirational book section of the
library, Bill became intrigued by the title Think and Grow Rich.
He borrowed the book and began to read. He read it once, and
then he read it again. And even though he read it the third time,
Bill McCall was unable to understand exactly how he could apply
the principles whereby some of the richest men in the world
acquired their wealth. He told us:
"I was reading Think and Grow Rich for the fourth time while
walking leisurely along a business street in Sydney. And then it
happened! It happened suddenly. I stopped in front of a meat
market window and glanced up. And in that very fraction of a
second I had a flash of inspiration." He smiled as he continued:
"I exclaimed aloud, That's it! I've got it!' I was startled at my
emotional outburst. So was a lady who was passing by. She
stopped and looked at me in amazement. I hurried home with my
new discovery." He continued seriously:
"You see, I was reading Chapter Four entitled Auto-suggestion.
The subheading was The Medium for Influencing the
Subconscious Mind.
"Now I remember that when I was a boy my father read aloud
from Emile Coue's little book Self-Mastery Through Conscious
Autosuggestion" He then looked al Napoleon Hill and said:
79
"It was you who pointed out in your book that if Emile Coue was
successful in helping individuals avoid sickness and in bringing
the sick back to good health, through conscious autosuggestion,
autosuggestion could also be used to acquire riches or anything
else one might desire 'Get rich through autosuggestion': that was
my great discovery. It was a new concept to me." McCall then
described the principles. It almost seemed as if he had memorized
them from the book itself.
"You know: conscious autosuggestion is the agency of control
through which an individual may voluntarily feed his
subconscious mind on thoughts of a creative nature, or, by
neglect, permit thoughts of a destructive nature to find their way
into the rich garden of his mind
"When you read aloud twice daily the written statement of your
desire for money with emotion and concentrated attention, and
you see and feel yourself already in possession of the money, you
communicate the object of your desire directly to your
subconscious mind. Through repetition of this procedure, you
voluntarily create thought habits, which are favorable to your
efforts to transmute desire into its monetary equivalent.
"Let me say again: It is most important that when you read aloud
the statement of your desire through which you are endeavoring
to develop a money consciousness, you read with emotion and
strong feeling.
"Your ability to use the principles of autosuggestion will depend
very largely upon your capacity to concentrate upon a given
desire until that desire becomes a burning desire.
"When I arrived home, out of breath for running, I immediately
sat down at the dining room table and wrote: 'My definite major
aim is to be a millionaire by I960.'" Still looking at Napoleon
80
Hill, be continued, "You mentioned that a person should be
specific as to the amount of money he wants and set a date. I
did."
Now, the man to whom we were talking was not the young Bill
McCall who failed at the age of 19. He became known as the
Honorable William V. McCall, the youngest man ever to become
a member of the Australian Parliament; as the former chairman of
the board of directors of the Coca-Cola subsidiary in Sydney; and
as the director of 22 family-owned corporations. And as to riches
— he became a millionaire, and quite as rich as some of the men
he had read about in the book from which he got the inspiration
to explore the power of his subconscious mind with self-
suggestion, (Incidentally, he became a millionaire four years
ahead of schedule!)
Day by day in every way, I am getting better and better! You
will note we use the word "self-suggestion" as being synonymous
with the term "conscious autosuggestion" used by Emile Coue.
McCall remembered that when he was a boy his father bad
benefited from a great discovery found in a book of his day — a
discovery that every man, woman and child can effectively
employ when he finds it for himself. Like Bill McCall and his
father, you too can properly employ the power of conscious
autosuggestion.
Now conscious autosuggestion was revealed to Emile Coue
because he dared to explore the powers of his own mind and the
minds of others. Before he made his great discovery, he used
hypnosis to cure the physical illnesses of his patients. But after
making his great discovery, which was in reality based on a
simple natural law, he abandoned the use of hypnosis.
And how did he find and recognize this natural law?
81
Emile Coue's great discovery was made when he found the
answer to some questions he asked himself. They were:
Question No. 1: Is it the suggestion of the doctor, or is it
the suggestion in the mind of the patient, that effects a
cure?
Answer: Coue proved conclusively that it was the mind of
the patient that subconsciously or consciously made the
suggestion to which his own mind and body reacted.
Without either {unconscious) autosuggestion or conscious
autosuggestion, external suggestions are not effective.
Question No. 2: If the suggestion of the doctor stimulates
internal suggestion of the patient, why can't the patient
use healthful, positive suggestions on himself? And why
can't he refrain from harmful negative suggestions?
The answer to his second question came quickly: Anyone, even a
child, can be taught to develop a positive mental attitude. The
method is to repeat positive affirmations such as: Day by day, in
every way, through the grace of God, I am getting better and
better.
Throughout Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude you will
see many self-motivators which you can I use for your own self-
suggestion. And if by now you don't know how to use self-
suggestion, you will be you complete this book.
When death's door is about to open. There are over 450,000
children born out of wedlock in the United States each year,
and over a million and a half teenagers enter penal institutions for
car thefts and other crimes. These personal tragedies could
in many instances be avoided if: (a) the parents learned how to
employ suggestion properly, and (b) if their sons and daughters
82
were taught how effectively to use spiritual self-suggestion.
Through the proper use of suggestion, these young people could
be motivated to develop inviolable moral standards through
their own conscious autosuggestion. And they would know how
to neutralize or repel the undesirable suggestions of their
associates in an intelligent manner.
Of course, every individual responds to (unconscious) auto-
suggestion throughout his life more often than he does to
conscious autosuggestion. In such instances he responds to habit
and the inner urge of the subconscious. When a man with PMA is
faced with a serious personal problem, self-motivators flash from
the subconscious to the conscious to aid him. This is especially
true in times of emergency — especially when death's door is
about to be opened. Such was the case with Ralph Weppner of
Too-woomba, Queensland, Australia, one of our PMA Science of
Success course students.
It was 1:30 in the morning. In a small hospital bedroom two
nursing sisters were keeping vigil beside Ralph's body. At 4:30
the afternoon before an emergency call had been made to his
family to rush to the hospital. When they arrived at his bedside,
Ralph was in a state of coma as the result of a severe heart attack.
The family was now out in the corridor, each one worrying or
praying in his own special way.
In the dimly lit bedroom two nursing sisters worked anxiously —
one on each wrist — trying to feel a pulse beat. Because Ralph
had not come out of the coma during this entire six hour period
and the doctor had done all that he felt he could, the doctor had
left the room. He had gone to visit one of his other hospital
patients who was also in a critical condition.
83
Ralph couldn't move, talk, or feel anything. Yet he could hear the
voices of the sisters. He could think quite clearly during portions
of this period. He heard one sister excitedly state:
"He's not breathing! Can you pick up a beat?"
The answer was, "No."
Again and again he heard the question and answer: "Can you now
pick up a beat?" "No."
"I'm all right," he thought, "but I must tell them. Somehow I must
tell them."
At the same time he was amused at the sisters for being fooled
like that. He kept thinking, "I'm quite all right. I'm not going to
die. But how — how — can I tell them?"
And then he remembered the self-motivator he had learned: You
can do it if you believe you can!
He tried to open his eyes, but it seemed the more he tried, the
more he failed. His eyelids wouldn't respond to the command of
his will. He tried to move his arm, his leg, his head — but he
couldn't feel any reaction at all. In fact, he didn't feel a thing.
Again and again he tried to open his eyes, until at last he heard
the words: "I saw one eyelid flicker — he's still there."
"I felt no fear," Ralph says, "and still thought how amusing it
was. Periodically one sister called to me, 'Are you there, Mr.
Weppner? Are you there?' To which I would try to respond by
moving my eyelid to tell them that I was all right — I was still
there."
This went on for a considerable time until through constant effort
Ralph was at last able to open one, then both, eyes. It was then
84
that his doctor returned. With wonderful skill and persistence the
doctor and nurses brought him back to life.
Hidden persuaders. But it was the autosuggestion: You can do it
if you believe you can — that he had memorized from the PMA
Science of Success course — that helped to rescue him when he
was at death's door.
Now the books we read and the thoughts we think affect our
subconscious minds. But there are also unseen forces that
likewise have powerful effects even though they are subliminal
— below the realm of consciousness.
These unseen forces can be from known physical causes or from
unknown sources. Before discussing the unknown, let's illustrate
with an example that is now common knowledge since the
publishing of Hidden Persuaders by Vance Packard. The story
first appeared in American newspapers and later was picked up in
magazines. Let's consider a report that appeared in a leading
national magazine on the subject of subliminal advertising. The
report tells of an experiment conducted in a New Jersey movie
theater, in which advertising messages were flashed on the screen
so fast that the viewers were not consciously aware of them.
During a period of six weeks, more than forty thousand persons
unknowingly became subjects of this test, while attending the
theater. Flashed on the screen by a special process that made
them invisible to the naked eye were two advertising messages
concerning products that were available in the theater lobby. At
the end of the six weeks, results were tabulated: sales of one of
the products had soared over 50 per cent, while sales of the other
product rose almost 20 per cent.
The inventor of the process explained that, although the messages
were invisible, they still had taken effect on many in the audience
85
because of the ability of the subconscious mind to absorb
impressions that are too fleeting to be registered consciously.
When this story appeared in the press, the public was horrified
"by this attempt to channel our thinking habits, our purchasing
decisions, and our thought processes" by the use of subliminal
suggestion. People were afraid. They feared brainwashing in its
most subtle form. Yet it is amazing to us that someone didn't take
the PMA approach. Subliminal suggestion can be employed for
desirable objectives, too. Everyone knows that power can be used
for evil or for good, depending upon how it is directed.
Now that the experiment has proved its purpose, it doesn't take
much imagination to see what the beneficial results to the viewers
would be should the following self-motivators be flashed on a
movie screen:
God is always a good God!
Day by day, in every way, through the grace of God, you
are getting better and better!
Have the courage to face the truth!
What the mind of man can conceive and believe, the
mind of man can achieve with PMA!
Every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater
benefit for those who have positive mental attitude!
You can do it if you believe you can!
This would be a PMA approach, provided, of course, the consent
of the audience was obtained in advance.
86
Another illustration of a known physical force affecting the
subconscious mind can be shown by the effect of radar on
navigators.
Why did the SS Andrea Doria and the SS Valchem sink? When
the Andrea Doria, captained by Pierre Clamai, and the
Stockholm, under Captain H. G. Nordenson, collided
approximately 50 miles off Nantucket Island, 50 persons died.
The Andrea Doria was sighted by the radar operator of the
Stockholm when they were 10 miles apart.
The Grace Line luxury liner, the Santa Rosa under Captain Frank
S. Siwik, collided with the tanker Valchem on March 26, 1959,
22 miles off the New Jersey coast Four crewmen were killed.
Second Mate Walter Wells, the radar operator on the Santa Rosa,
claimed he had made two plottings of the tanker Valchem's
course.
No satisfactory explanation of the true cause of these collisions
has resulted from the investigations in either of these instances.
Could the waves from the radar instruments have been the real
cause? Perhaps Sidney A. Schneider has the answer.
As a young teen-ager, Sidney A. Schneider of Skokie, Illinois,
became interested in hypnotism when he observed his older
brother, a university student, successfully place his first subject
under hypnosis. Sidney became an expert hypnotist. During his
business career he became a radio operator and an engineer in
electronics.
In the Second World War Sidney Schneider was a vital part of the
system known as "I. F. F." — Information, Friend or Foe. His job
was to see to it that every ship leaving our country was equipped
with radar. He noticed that radar operators sometimes went into a
87
trance. They weren't aware that they had been in a trance when
they came out of it.
Because of his knowledge of hypnosis and electronics, Schneider
concluded that the fixed attention of the naval employees took
place when the waves from the radar machine were synchronized
with the brain waves of the operator. On this theory he changed
the waves on the radar instrument and eliminated the recurrence
of the trances.
Sidney Schneider told us that he converted his conclusions
regarding the principle that placed the seamen operating radar in
a trance into the Brain Wave Synchronizer, a machine which he
invented after the war.
What is the Brain Wave Synchronizer?
It is an electronic instrument designed to induce various levels of
hypnosis by subliminal and photic (light) stimulation of the brain
waves. The instrument can be used alone or combined with a tape
recording of the therapist's verbal suggestions. No physical
connections or attachments are placed on the patient. Results are
obtained at any distance in which the light in the machine is
visible. The apparatus induces light to deep hypnotic levels in
over 90 per cent of the subjects in an average time of three
minutes.
In an experiment with the Brain Wave Synchronizer, none of the
persons involved was informed about the machine or what it
could do. Neither were they told that they were subjects of an
experiment. Yet 30 per cent of them were hypnotized to various
degrees, ranging from light to deep states.
"Why and how does the Brain Wave Synchronizer work?" we
asked.
88
"It is like a television transmitter," Schneider said. "The human
brain produces pulses (waves) of electricity in several frequency
ranges. This knowledge has been applied in the field of medicine
since 1929 and the invention of the electroencephalograph
commonly known as the EEG machine, an apparatus for
recording brain waves.
"My machine operates much like a television system," Schneider
continued. "The reason the picture on your receiving set does not
drift up or down is that the pulses generated within the set
synchronize with corresponding pulses generated by the
transmitting television station. The receiver is forced to operate at
a rate controlled by the transmitter and the picture must obey.
"Like the transmitter of a television station, the Brain Wave
Synchronizer also produces synchronizing pulses. And through
photic stimulation, the waves sent from the synchronizer cause
the frequency of the brain waves also to lock in step. At this point
hypnosis can be achieved. Just compare your brain to a receiving
set, and the Brain Wave Synchronizer to a television transmitter."
And you will see as you continue to read that in addition to
comparing your brain to a receiving set, you can compare it to a
television transmitter also.
A little knowledge becomes a dangerous thing. We have just
explored some of the unseen forces from known physical causes.
Now let's proceed further into the realm of the unknown: the
thrilling field of psychic phenomena, such as:
1. ESP (extrasensory perception)... awareness of or response to an
external event or influence not apprehended by sensory means.
Here are included:
(a)  Telepathy... thought transference
89
(b) Clairvoyance...   the   power   of   discerning   objects   not
present to the senses
(c) Precognition... seeing into the future
(d) Postcognition... seeing into the past
2. Psychokinesis... the effect of the mind on an object.
Now let's be realistic and keep our feet firmly on the ground.
Let's explore the unknown with common sense! You'll be in
danger unless you use good logic and avoid the gathering of
cobwebs in your thinking. Facts should be your stepping stones
over the river of doubt. Therefore, let an experienced guide direct
you along safe paths. And we will introduce you to such a guide.
But before we do, let's talk about the past.
Thomas J. Hudson's famous book, The Law of Psychic
Phenomena, when published in 1893, became a best seller. (The
book is published today in paperback by the Hudson-Cohen
Publishing Company, Monterey, California.) It contained many
thrilling stories of reported psychic experiences. The
imaginations of tens of thousands of people who read this book
were stimulated. Some were ready. Some were not.
From then on public interest in psychic phenomena made rapid
progress. But many persons, not properly prepared, injured
themselves by becoming crackpots. This was due to the
awesomeness and magnetic interest a little knowledge of psychic
powers generated within them. There is a noticeable tendency of
some persons who are not properly educated and mature in their
thinking and not very well adjusted emotionally to become
fascinated with this intriguing study. It is easy to understand why
so many religious leaders, scientists, and persons responsible for
90
the welfare of the people found the study of psychic phenomena
an anathema:
1. Imaginations ran rampant and threatened the sanity of the
people.
2. Fact and fiction seemed to be indistinguishable.
3. Hypnotism by amateurs and vaudeville entertainers, as well as
the trickery and frauds practiced by fakirs, mediums, and
charlatans abused the minds of the public.
4. Basic religious principles were twisted in a direction that led to
evil.
Anything associated with psychic phenomena became repellent.
It was taboo.
In spite of the dangers, taboos, and social or professional
ostracism, there were courageous, honorable men with good
common sense who had the courage to explore for the truth.
But it remained for the long, courageous fight of Dr. Joseph
Banks Rhine, formerly of Duke University, inspired and assisted
by his wife Dr. Louisa E. Rhine, to clothe the study of psychic
phenomena with respectability. This is due to the impeccable
character of Dr. Rhine and to his 30 years of controlled
laboratory experiments based on mathematical laws. His task was
a difficult one because spontaneous psychic phenomena are not
apt to occur in a laboratory. Such phenomena occur when least
expected, and most often when a person is under the greatest
emotional strain, or possessed of an intensified obsessional desire
— often simultaneously with the death of a loved one.
Westinghouse invests in ESP communication. It is apparent
that any writer on the subject of psychic phenomena today
91
endeavors to have the protection of a part of the cloak of Dr.
Rhine's respectability by referring to Dr. Rhine and Duke
University to make his own theories digestible. We are no
exception. We urgently suggest that if you are interested further,
you read The Reach of the Mind and the other books of which Dr.
Rhine is the author or co-author. Our recommendation: Let Dr.
Joseph Banks Rhine be your guide.
And how successful has Dr Rhine's work been in breaking down
the resistance to investigation and belief in these strange
mindpowers? A fair test, it would seem to us, lies in the fact that
hard-headed businessmen are convinced and are making
experiments of their own: In an interview, Dr. Peter A.
Castruccio, Director of the Westinghouse Astronautics Institute,
confirmed that Westinghouse scientists are engaged in research to
find a means of using telepathy and clairvoyance for long
distance communication. Dr. Castruccio too had many lengthy
visits with Dr. Rhine before a decision was reached to engage in
this great experiment.
And will the search for ways and means to harness telepathy and
clairvoyance and make them commercially feasible be
successful? Let us answer this as follows: Not too long ago
people were scoffing at ideas that were unbelievable to them then
but are taken for granted today: (a) matter being turned into
energy and energy into matter; (b) the breaking of the atom; (c)
man-made satellites; (d) jet power; or (e) everyday necessities
like television, for example.
And what about the electronic computer that was designed from
the human computer: the human brain and the nervous system.
Every one was conceived, believed and achieved by men with
PMA! Machines that operate with the speed of light — 186,300
miles per second! Machines that can calculate 40,000 arithmetical
operations per second and detect and correct their own errors!
92
Machines that became a reality because man built into them
electrical circuits which in many respects function like the known
electrical activity of the nervous system of your own physical
body. Our answer:
What the mind of man can conceive and believe, the mind of man
can achieve with PMA!
But no machine or manmade invention is as marvelous as the
wonderful human computer you own: your brain and your
nervous system, with their power of electrical activity.
Man is more than a body with a brain.
You are a mind with a body — a mind, possessing, and also
affected by, powers known and unknown! A mind composed of
two parts: the conscious and the subconscious.
Here we have stressed most the concept of the subconscious mind
— its powers and the forces known and unknown that affect it.
But what about the conscious mind? That is equally important.
And you will read about it in the next chapter entitled... And
Something More!
Now, if your reaction to what you have read has not given you an
insight on how you can turn the right knob or push the right
button to get what you want from the machine you own, dare to
explore the powers of your mind. Be guided by Pilot No 4... And
Something More!
PILOT NO. 4
Thoughts to Steer By
93
1. You are a mind with a body. Your body is an electrical
machine. Your brain is a mechanism that is an electrical
marvel.
2. Your mind has two parts: the conscious and the subconscious.
They work together.
3. Conscious autosuggestion and self-suggestion are synony-
mous, and are contrasted with the word autosuggestion, an un-
conscious activity. Autosuggestion automatically sends
messages from the subconscious to the conscious mind as well
as to parts of the body. The subconscious mind is the seat
of habit, memory, inviolable standards of conduct, etc.
4. Day by day in every respect I am getting better and better.
Self-affirmations repeated with frequency, rapidity, and
emotion affect the subconscious mind and cause it to react.
Bill Mc-Call acquired wealth through the use of self-
suggestion.
5. Coue's great discovery was: you can use healthful, positive
suggestions to help yourself. And you can also refrain from
negative, harmful suggestions.
6. Learn to use the proper suggestion in influencing others. Learn
to employ the right conscious autosuggestions. When you do,
you can have: physical, mental and moral health, happiness
and success.
7. You can do it if you have PMA and believe you can.
8. Hidden persuaders: Take the PMA approach.
9. Your brain sends out energy in the form of brain waves. And
this energy is power which can affect another person or an
object.
94
10. A little knowledge may be a dangerous thing. Dare to explore
the powers of your mind. When you enter the dangerous,
unexplored territory of psychic phenomena, let Dr. Joseph
Banks Rhine be your guide.

CHAPTER 5
... And Something More
Have you sincerely tried — and still failed?
Perhaps you failed because there was something more that was
needed to bring you the success you were seeking. Euclid's axiom
says: "The whole is equal to the sum of all the parts and is greater
than any of its parts." This can be related, assimilated, and
applied to every result or achievement. Conversely, any part is
smaller than the whole. Therefore, it's important that you add all
the necessary parts to complete the whole.
A negative mental attitude is one of the primary causes failure.
You may be needlessly ignorant of facts, universal laws, and
powers. You may know many of them but fail to apply them to a
specific need. You may not know how you can affect, use,
control, or harmonize with powers known and unknown.
When you seek success with PMA, you keep trying. You keep
searching to find something more. Failure is experienced by those
who, when they experience defeat, stop trying to find the
something more.
It's easy when yon learn the something more and experience
the know-how! Give a puzzle to a child, and he may not solve it.
If he keeps trying and learns how to solve it, he can then work it
quickly. You aren't a child.
But perhaps there are several of life's puzzles you would like to
solve. You can solve them more easily with PMA. For example,
there once was a song writer who wrote a song but couldn't get it
published. George M. Cohan bought it and added something
96
more. The something more made George M. Cohan a fortune. He
merely added three little words: Hip, Hip, Hooray!
Thomas Edison tried more than ten thousand experiments before
he developed a successful incandescent lamp. But after each
defeat he kept searching for something more until he found what
he was looking for. When the unknown became known to him,
innumerable electric light bulbs could be manufactured. It was
necessary only to apply the universal laws that had always existed
but which had not been previously recognized as applicable for
the specific invention.
There are many cures and preventatives for diseases. But at a
given time they may be unknown. The medical preventative for
polio was unknown until Dr. Jonas Edward Salk used principles
of universal law that were previously not applied by the medical
profession for the prevention of this dreaded disease.
You may make a million dollars by employing a success formula.
If you lose your money, you can make another million — and
even more! That is, provided you know the formula and apply it.
Suppose you didn't recognize the formula that helped you make
your first million. You may fail in your second attempt because
you deviate from the principles of success that are applicable. On
your second attempt, you may need to make adjustments for
changing conditions. But the principles will remain the same.
Orville and Wilbur Wright succeeded in flying because they
added something more! Many inventors came exceedingly close
to inventing the airplane before the Wright brothers. The Wright
brothers used the same principles that were employed by the
others. But they added — something more. They created a new
combination. So they succeeded where all others failed. The
something more was rather simple. They attached movable flaps
of a particular design to the edges of the wings so the pilot could
97
control them and maintain the plane's equilibrium. These flaps
were the forerunners of the modern aileron.
You'll notice there's a common denominator to all these success
stories. In each case, the secret ingredient was the application of a
previously unapplied universal law. That made the difference. So,
if you are standing on the threshold of success without being able
to pass over, try adding something more. It needn't be much. The
words "Hip, were all it took to make a hit tune. Tiny flaps were
all it took to make an airplane failed. It isn't necessarily the
quantity of something more, but the "inspired quality" that
counts.
Why did the Supreme Court decide that Alexander Graham
Bell invented the telephone? Many persons claimed to have
invented the telephone before Alexander Graham Bell. Among
those who held prior patents were Gray, Edison, Dolbear,
McDonough, Vanderweyde, and Reis. Philipp Reis was the only
one who apparently came close to success. The little difference
that made the big difference was a single screw. Reis didn't know
that it he had turned one screw one quarter of a turn, he would
have transformed interrupted current into continuous current.
Then he would have been successful!
In a United States Supreme Court case, the court noted:
That Reis knew what had to be done in order to transmit
speech by electricity is very apparent, for in his first paper
he said: "As soon as it is possible to produce, anywhere
and in any manner, vibrations whose curves shall be the
same as those of any given tone or combination of tones,
we shall receive the same impression as that tone or
combination of tones would have produced on us."
The Court further noted:
98
Reis discovered how to reproduce musical tones, but he
did no more. He could sing through his apparatus, but he
could not talk. From the beginning to the end he has
conceded this.
As in the case of the Wright brothers, the something more Bell
added was comparatively simple. He switched from an
intermittent to a continuous current, the only type capable of
reproducing human speech. The two currents are exactly the same
direct current. "Intermittent" means breaking with a slight pause.
Specifically, Bell kept the circuit open instead of breaking the
circuit intermittently as Reis had done. The Court concluded:
Reis never thought of it, and he failed to transmit speech
telegraphically. Bell did, and he succeeded. Under such
circumstances it is impossible to hold that what Reis did
was an anticipation of the discovery of Bell. To follow
Reis is to fail, but to follow Bell is to succeed. The
difference between the two is just the difference between
failure and success. If Reis had kept on he might have
found out the way to succeed, but he stopped and failed.
Bell took up his work and carried it on to a successful
result.
His   silent   senior  partner   inspired   him   to   success.   R.   G.
LeTourneau, builder of heavy earth-moving equipment,
motivated thousands of persons with his inspirational speeches.
In these talks, he referred reverently to "my Senior Partner." He
told about the inspiration and help he received from the "Partner."
LeTourneau had little formal education. But he performed feats
of engineering that are astounding.
As a sub-contractor on the great Hoover Dam in Nevada,
LeTourneau lost a fortune because he ran into an unexpected
strata of rock. The cost of drilling through the rock was more than
99
he had calculated in estimating his contract. So he went broke
trying to fulfill his end of the bargain.
But instead of brooding over his loss, LeTourneau turned to
prayer. How did he pray? By expressing gratitude — profound
gratitude — for what he had left: A sound body. A strong pair of
hands. A brain that could think. And something more. "In my
hour of greatest distress," said LeTourneau, "I found my greatest
asset in the revelation and discovery of a silent Senior Partner. I
have since recognized this Partner in my personal and business
life. Everything I have — everything I have done that has been
worthwhile — I owe to Him."
Napoleon Hill was associated with Mr. LeTourneau for eighteen
months and had an opportunity to observe him closely. By this
time LeTourneau had become a well-known inspirational
lecturer. He devoted much of his time to traveling around the
country in his private plane, preaching his message: "It's
wonderful to be in partnership with God." One night when the
two men were flying home from a speaking engagement in North
Carolina, something interesting happened.
Soon after his pilot took off, Mr. LeTourneau went to sleep. In
about thirty minutes Napoleon Hill saw him take in it. After the
plane landed, Napoleon Hill asked Mr. LeTourneau if he
remembered writing in his notebook.
"Why no!" exclaimed LeTourneau. He immediately pulled the
notebook from his pocket and looked at it. He said: "Here it is!
I've been looking for this for several months! Here's the answer to
a problem that has kept me from completing a machine we are
working on!"
When you receive a flash of inspiration, write it down! This may
be the something more that you are looking for. We believe that
100
communication with Infinite Intelligence is through the
subconscious mind. We believe you should establish the habit of
immediately writing down flashes of inspiration as they are
communicated to you from the subconscious to the conscious.
Albert Einstein developed intricate and profound theories
regarding the universe and the natural laws that control it. Yet he
used only the simplest — but most important — of instruments
ever invented: a pencil and a piece of paper. He wrote down his
questions and answers. You Will develop your mental powers
when you learn and develop the habit of asking yourself
questions — when you learn and develop the habit of using
pencil and paper to write down your questions, ideas, and
answers.
It is unlikely that Einstein and other scientists would have come
to their successful conclusions unless they had learned from the
recorded knowledge of mathematicians and scientists who
preceded them. It is also unlikely that Einstein would have tried
unless he had been motivated to search for universal principles
after having developed the habit of engaging in thinking time and
action. Do you know of any great thinker, or person of
achievement, who does not make notes of ideas that occur to
him?
Learn creative thinking from the creative thinker! Your
Creative Power and Applied Imagination by Alex F. Osborn, of
the advertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn, have
inspired hundreds of thousands of persons to engage in creative
thinking. What is equally important, these people have been
motivated to positive, constructive action. Thinking is not
creative unless it is followed through with action.
Osborn, like so many creative thinkers, used a notepad and a
pencil as favorite working tools. When an idea occurred, he jotted
101
it down. He, like other great men of accomplishment, engaged in
thinking, planning, and study time.
Alex Osborn stated an obvious truth when he said: "Everyone has
some creative ability, but most people haven't learned to use it."
Osbon's brainstorming methods, explained in his easily-read
textbook Applied Imagination, are being employed in college
classrooms, factories, business offices, churches, clubs, and in the
home. Brainstorming, as developed by Osborn, is a very simple
method whereby two or more persons use their collective
imaginations to come up with ideas that flash from their
subconscious to their conscious minds in answer to a question
incorporating a specific problem. The ideas are written down just
as fast as they strike the minds of the participants. No critical
judgment is permitted until after many ideas are written down.
Later the ideas are screened and judged to determine their prac-
ticality and value.
La Salle College in Philadelphia, and many universities
throughout the country, teach well-rounded courses in creative
thinking which include the methods used by creative thinkers in
many phases of business and industry.
It was just such creative thinking that enabled Dr. Elmer Gates to
make this world a better place in which to live. Dr. Gates was a
great American teacher, philosopher, psychologist, scientist, and
inventor. During his lifetime, he developed hundreds of
inventions and discoveries in the various arts and sciences.
He did his creative thinking by "sitting for ideas." Dr. Gates' own
life proved that his methods of brain and body building could
develop a healthy body and increase the efficiency of the mind.
Napoleon Hill recalls how, armed with a letter of introduction
from Andrew Carnegie, he went to visit Dr. Gates at his Chevy
102
Chase laboratory. When Napoleon Hill arrived, Dr. Gates'
secretary told him: "I'm sorry, but... I'm not permitted to disturb
Dr. Gates at this time."
"How long do you think it will be before I can see him?"
Napoleon Hill asked.
"I don't know, but it might take as long as three hours,"
"Do you mind telling me why you are unable to disturb him?"
She hesitated and then responded, "He is sitting for ideas?"
Napoleon Hill smiled. "What does that mean — sitting for
ideas?"
She returned the smile and said, "Maybe we'd better let Dr. Gates
explain. I really don't know how long it will take, but you're
welcome to wait. If you prefer to come again, I'll see if I can
make a definite appointment for you."
Mr. Hill decided to wait. It was a valuable decision. What he
learned was well worth waiting for. This is how Napoleon Hill
tells what happened:
When Dr. Gates finally came into the room and his
secretary introduced us, I jokingly told him what his
secretary had said. After he read the letter of introduction
from Andrew Carnegie, he responded pleasantly, "Would
you be interested in seeing where I sit for ideas and how I
go about it?"
He led me to a small, soundproof room. The only
furniture in the room consisted of a plain table and a
103
chair. On the table were pads of paper, several pencils,
and a push-button to turn the lights off and on.
In our interview Dr. Gates explained that when he was
unable to obtain an answer to a problem, he went into the
room, closed the door, sat down, turned off the lights,
and engaged in deep concentration. He applied the
success principle of controlled attention, asking his
subconscious mind to give him an answer to his specific
problem, whatever it might be. On some occasions ideas
didn't seem to come through. At other times they would
immediately flow into his mind. And in some instances it
would take as long as two hours before they made an
appearance. As soon as ideas began to crystalize, he
would turn on the lights and begin to write.
Dr. Elmer Gates refined and perfected more than two
hundred patents which other inventors had undertaken
but which had fallen just short of success. He was able to
add the missing ingredients — the something more. His
method was to begin by examining the application for the
patent and its drawings until he found its weakness, the
something more that was lacking. He would bring a copy
of the patient application and drawings into the room.
While sitting for ideas, he would concentrate on finding
the solution to a specific problem.
When Napoleon Hill asked Dr. Gates to explain the source of his
results while sitting for ideas, he gave the following explanation:
"The sources of all ideas are:
1. Knowledge  stored in the  subconscious mind and acquired
through individual experience, observation, and education.
2. Knowledge accumulated by others through the same media,
which may be communicated by telepathy.
104
3. The great universal storehouse of Infinite Intelligence, wherein
is stored all knowledge and all facts, and which may be
contacted through the subconscious section of the mind.
"When I sit for ideas, I may tune in to one or all of these sources.
If other sources of ideas are available, I do not know what they
are."
Dr. Elmer Gates found the time to concentrate and think in his
search for something more. He knew specifically what he was
looking for. And he followed through with positive action!
In Chapter Seven, we will discuss how you can "Learn To See"
so that your search for something more will be made easier. In
your search, you may fail. But in failing you may succeed in
discovering something even greater. Ask yourself, "Why?" Be
observant. Think! Get into action!
The Bible and both a good, comprehensive dictionary and an
encyclopedia should, we believe, be in every home. They also
can help in your search for something more.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ASHAMED
TO BE A FAILURE
LIKE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS!
Look in your Encyclopaedia Britannica and you'll find the
thrilling, exciting story of Christopher Columbus. He studied
astronomy, geometry, and cosmography at the University of
Pavia. The Book of Marco Polo, theories of geographers, reports
and traditions of mariners, as well as floating works of art and
craftsmanship of non-European origin cast up by the sea — all
these stimulated his imagination.
105
Step by step over the years he came to the firm belief, through
inductive reasoning, that the world was a sphere. Having reached
this conclusion, he was convinced through deductive reasoning,
that the Asiatic continent could be reached by sailing westward
from Spain just as well as Marco Polo had reached it by traveling
east. He developed a burning desire to prove his theory. He
sought the necessary financial backing, ships, and men to explore
the unknown and find something more.
He got into action! He kept his mind on his objective. Over a
period of ten years he was often on the verge of receiving the
necessary help. But the deception of a king... the ridicule,
suspicion, and fear of subordinate government officials... the
disbelief of those who wanted to help him but who at the last
moment refused because of the skepticism of their scientific
advisors... all brought defeat after defeat. He kept trying.
In 1492 he received the help for which he had so persistently
searched and prayed! In August of that year he sailed westward
for India, China, and Japan. He was on the right course and
headed in the right direction.
You know the story. After he landed on the islands in the
Caribbean, he returned to Spain with gold, cotton, Parrots,
curious arms, mysterious plants, unknown birds and beasts, and
several natives. He thought he had achieved his objective and had
reached the islands off India. He had failed. He had not reached
Asia. But, without being aware of it immediately, Columbus had
found something more! Quite a bit more!
You, like Christopher Columbus, may fail to reach your major
objectives, or your magnificent obsessions. , like him, may fail in
your efforts to reach a destination in the realm of the unknown.
But you may discover something more — something equaling the
wealth of the Americas. You, like him, may inspire and direct
106
those who follow you to head in the right direction, on the right
course, and to continue further into the unknown until they
achieve the worthwhile objectives you conceived. You, like
Columbus, have the time and the power to think. You, like him,
can persistently strive with a positive mental attitude to achieve
your definite major aims to find something more.
You don't need to be ashamed to be a failure like Christopher
Columbus.
. . . And something more! How can yon apply it? By now you
should be in a position to extract principles from specific
illustrations so that you can relate, assimilate, and use them. We
agree with Admiral H. G. Rickover in the fundamental truths of
his statement:
Among the young engineers we interview we find few
who have received thorough training in engineering
fundamentals or principles; but most have absorbed
quantities of facts... much easier to learn than principles
but of little use without application of principles. Once a
principle has been acquired it becomes apart of one and is never lost.
It can be applied to novel problems and does not become
obsolete as do all facts in a changing society...
Learn the principles. Apply them. If you're not making
satisfactory progress toward achieving your aims, look for the
something morel It may be known or unknown. But you'll find it,
if you take the necessary time to study, think, plan, and search for
it.
Now this chapter would not be complete without reference to
Cosmic Habit Force. Use cosmic habit force is one of the 17
success principles.
107
And the concept of cosmic habit force is easy to understand. For
it is a name that we have given to applied power of any natural,
or universal, principle or law, known or unknown.
Cosmic habit force can be simply defined as: the use of universal
law, whether it is known or unknown to you.
As an example, it's easy to understand that when an object falls to
the ground, the law of gravity is being applied. And, therefore, if
you want an object to fall from a given height, you use cosmic
habit force. And in this particular instance — the law of gravity.
But the law of gravity, or any other law, is not in itself a power.
Yet when you properly use the principle, then power is employed
according to universal law.
And thus: the breaking of the atom, every invention, every
chemical formula, every psychic phenomenon, every individual
action and reaction — be it physical, mental, or spiritual — is the
result of the use of natural law. For every result there is a cause.
And the result is brought about through the use of cosmic habit
force.
Again, man is a mind with a body. And he can think. It is through
thinking that he learns how to use cosmic habit force. And his
thinking can bring the thoughts he thinks into reality.
This concept is not difficult to comprehend, for in 1905 Albert
Einstein gave to the world his now famous formula: E = mc2.
This formula explains the relationship between energy and
matter. When matter approaches the speed of light, we call it
energy, and as the velocity slows down to zero, it remains matter.
In the formula: E is energy, m is mass or matter, and c represents
the velocity of light.
108
And thus we see that Einstein's formula is a word symbol of one
of the laws of cosmic habit force. And by understanding and
applying this formula man has been able to turn matter into
energy and energy into matter, and to use atomic power for
constructive purposes such as: to light an entire city, to power
ships, or even for such everyday affairs as to develop heat for
cooking.
... And something more — we can now see that because matter
and energy are the same thing, everything in the universe is
related.
Now "You've Got a Problem? That's Good! And you'll learn in
the next chapter how to adapt many of the lessons learned in this
chapter to your own life. And then you will be able successfully
to meet the problems created by the universal law of change,
which — like all natural law — is the result of cosmic habit
force.

Thoughts to Steer By
1. ... And something more. What does the important principle
contained in this chapter mean to you and how can you apply
it?
2. If you have failed in an endeavor, could it be because you lack
something more — a missing number for a correct, winning
combination for success?
3. The whole is equal to the sum of all the parts and is greater
than any of its parts. Are any missing parts keeping you from
success?
109
4. The little difference between success and failure is often
something more: Hip, Hip, Hooray! A movable wing flap. A
quarter-turn of a screw.
5. Are you in partnership with your silent Senior Partner?
6. Use the simplest, but most important, of instruments ever
invented — paper and pencil — to write down flashes of
inspiration when they occur.
7. How does the technique of brainstorming differ from that of
"sitting for ideas"? What is the value of each?
8. Use the success principle of Controlled Attention.
9. Don't be afraid to be a failure like Christopher Columbus.
10. Have you established the habit of learning fundamental
principles, or do you merely absorb quantities of facts?
11. Do you understand and can you apply in your own experience
the fundamental truths and principles of Admiral H. G.
Rickover's statement?
Among the young engineers we interview we find few who have
received thorough training in engineering fundamentals or
principles; but most have absorbed quantities of facts... much
easier to learn than principles but of little use without application
of principles. Once a principle has been acquired it becomes a
part of one and is never lost. It can be applied to novel problems
and does not become obsolete as do all facts in a changing
society...

PART II
Five Mental Bombshells
for Attacking Success
CHAPTER 6
You've Got a Problem? That's Good!
So you've got a problem? That's good! Why? Because repeated
victories over your problems are the rungs on your ladder of
success. With each victory you grow in wisdom, stature, and
experience. You become a better, bigger, more successful person
each time you meet a problem and tackle and conquer it with
PMA.
Stop and think about it for a moment. Do you know of a single
instance where any real achievement was made in your life, or in
the life of any person in history, that was not due to a problem
with which the individual was faced?
Everyone has problems. This is because you and everything in
the universe are in a constant process of change. Change is an
inexorable natural law. What is important to you is that your
success or failure to meet the challenges of change are dependent
upon your mental attitude.
You can direct your thoughts and control your emotions, and thus
regulate your attitude. You can choose whether your attitude will
be positive or negative. You can decide whether you will affect,
use, control, or harmonize with the changes in yourself and your
environment. You can ordain your destiny. When you meet the
challenges of change with PMA, you can intelligently solve each
problem with which you are confronted.
in
How do you meet a problem with PMA? If you know and
believe the first principal element of a positive mental attitude:
God is always a good God — then you can effectively use the
following formula and meet your problems:
When you are faced with a problem that needs a solution,
regardless of how perplexing it may be:
1. Ask for Divine Guidance. Ask for help in finding the
right solution.
2. Engage in thinking time for the purpose of solving
your problems. Remember that every adversity has
the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit for those who
have PMA.
3. State the problem. Analyze and define it.
4. State to yourself enthusiastically: "That's good!"
5. Ask yourself some specific questions, such as:
(a) What's good about it?
(b) How can I turn this adversity into a seed of equivalent or
greater benefit; or how can I turn this liability into a
greater asset?
6. Keep searching for answers to these questions until you
find at least one answer that can work.
Now the problems that will confront you will, broadly speaking,
be of three kinds: personal problems — emotional, financial,
mental, moral, physical; family problems; and business or
professional problems. Because personal problems are the most
immediate problems experienced by all of us, we would like to
tell you the story of a man who met some of the most severe
problems a human being can experience. As you read this story,
112
see how he applied PMA to the solution of each difficulty until
he achieved ultimate victory.
He met his challenge to change with PMA at Leaven-worth
Penitentiary. This man was born in poverty. While in grade
school, he sold newspapers and sinned shoes in and around the
saloons on Seattle's waterfront to help his mother meet expenses.
Later he became a cabin boy on an Alaskan freighter during the
summer months. After be finished high school at the age of
seventeen, he left home. He became one of the horde of hobos
that rode the rails and traveled to every part of the United States.
His companions were hard-bitten men. He gambled, associated
with riffraff — men of the so-called "Border Legion." Soldiers of
fortune, fugitives, smugglers, cattle thieves, and the like were his
companions. He joined the forces of Pancho Villa in Mexico.
"You can't skate close to those extra-legal operations without
knowing about them, even if you have nothing to do with them,"
Charlie Ward said. "My mistake was being with the wrong com-
panions. My major sin was associating with people who were
bad."
From time to time he won large sums gambling, and then lost
them. Finally he was arrested for narcotics smuggling. He was
tried and convicted. Yet throughout his life Charlie Ward
maintained his innocence of the charge on which he was
convicted.
Charlie Ward was thirty-four years old when he entered
Leavenworth. He had never been in jail before in spite of his
associates. And he was embittered. He vowed that no prison was
strong enough to hold him. He looked for a chance to make a
break.
113
Then something happened! Charlie chose to change his attitude
from negative to positive. He met the challenge to change with
PMA. Something within him told him to stop being hostile and to
become the best prisoner in the prison. From that very moment
the entire tide of his life began to flow in the direction most
favorable for him. By the simple change from negative to positive
thinking, Charlie Ward began to master himself.
He changed the direction of his aggressive personality. He
forgave the federal agents who had brought about his plight. He
quit hating the judge who sentenced him.
He took a real good look at the Charlie Ward of the past. And he
resolved to avoid the very appearance of evil in the future. He
looked around for ways to make his stay in prison as pleasant as
possible.
First he asked himself some questions. And for the first time in
his adult life he found his answer in books, Particularly The Book.
In his prison cell he began to read the Bible. He read it and reread
it. Thereafter, and up to the date of his death at the age of
seventy-three, he read the Bible every day for inspiration,
guidance and help.
Because of his change in attitude, and consequently in behavior,
he began to attract favorable notice from the prison officials. And
one day a convict clerk told him that a trusty in the power plant
was to be released in three months. Charlie Ward knew little
about electricity, but there were books on electricity in the prison
library. So he studied. He learned what these books could teach
him.
At the end of three months, Charlie was ready. He applied for the
job. Something about his mannerism and his tone of voice
impressed   the   deputy   warden.    That   something   was   the
114
earnestness and sincerity of Charlie Ward's positive mental
attitude. He got the job!
Because he continued to study and work with PMA, Charlie
Ward became superintendent of the prison power plant with one
hundred and fifty men under him. He tried to inspire each one of
them to make the best of his situation.
When Herbert Hughes Bigelow, president of Brown & Bigelow
of St. Paul, Minnesota, arrived at Leavenworth on a conviction of
income tax evasion, Charlie Ward also befriended him. In fact, he
went out of his way to motivate Bigelow to adjust himself to his
environment. Mr. Bigelow was so appreciative of Charlie's
friendship and help that as his prison term approached its end, he
told Charlie, "You have been good to me. When you get out,
come to St. Paul. We will have a job for you."
Five weeks later Charlie was released from prison and went to St.
Paul. As he had promised, Mr. Bigelow gave Charlie a job. He
was given work as a laborer at $25 a week. Because Charlie
worked with PMA, he became a foreman within two months.
After a year, he became a superintendent Finally Charlie was
made vice president and general manager. And when Mr.
Bigelow died, Charlie was made president of Brown & Bigelow;
he continued in this capacity until his own death many years later.
Under Charlie's management, sales rose from less than three
million dollars to over fifty million dollars annually. Brown &
Bigelow became the largest company of its kind.
Because of Ward's positive mental attitude and his desire to help
those less fortunate, he himself received peace of mind,
happiness, love, and the better things in life. By presidential
decree, his rights as a citizen were restored in acknowledgment of
his exemplary life. Those who knew him held him in the highest
esteem, and were themselves inspired to help others.
115
Perhaps one of his most unusual and commendable activities was
his employment of over five hundred men and women who had
come from prisons. They continued their rehabilitation under his
stern and understanding guidance and inspiration. He never
forgot that he too had been a convict. He wore a tag on his
bracelet with his old prison number as a symbol.
Charlie Ward had been sentenced to prison. That was good!
Why? Who knows what might have become of Charlie Ward had
he continued in the direction in which he was headed. But in
prison he met the challenge to change. And there he learned to
use PMA to solve his personal problems. He made his world a
better world to live in. He became a bigger and better man. No
one will ever know the exact number of the needy who have
prayed for blessings to Charlie Ward in response to their inner
thoughts:
I was naked and ye clothed me; I was sick and ye visited
me. I was in prison and ye came unto me.
Fortunately not everyone is faced with problems as severe as
those which Charlie Ward was called upon to meet and solve. But
there is a lesson in Charlie's story, in addition to the fact that he
changed his attitude from negative to positive. You will recall,
Charlie himself said: "My greatest mistake was being with the
wrong companions." Negative attitudes are often contagious, and
bad habits are contagious. Let each of us look to our own
associations and be certain to keep them on the highest possible
level. One of the greatest services you can render to children is to
motivate them to motivate themselves to select the right kind of
friends and associates. Remember:
Vice is a monster of such awful mien
That to be hated needs but to be seen;
Yet, seen too oft, familiar with his face,
116
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.
Another force with which every human being has to contend, and
which, if not met with PMA, can cause physical, moral, and
mental destruction is the power of sex. Sex presents the greatest
challenge of change! Each human being hat the power to choose
for himself whether he will use the tremendous power of sex for
good or for evil. Each human being must contend with the
problems that will arise in his life because of sex.
You can transmute sex into virtue or vice. One of God's greatest
gifts to mankind is the power to procreate a human being. Sex is
the means of procreation. It is power! Like all power, it can be
used for good or for evil.
Sex is a physical function of the body under the control of the
subconscious and conscious mind. It is inherited. The physical
sex organs, works of God, like all His creations, are good. The
little difference that makes the big difference between the power
of sex being a virtue or a vice is mental attitude.
The inherent emotion of sex is one of the most powerful forces of
the subconscious mind. The effects of its motivating power can
be observed long before adolescence. This power blends with and
intensifies the driving force of all other emotions.
When it is in conflict with the will of the conscious mind, the
power of imagination, as it affects the emotion of sex, has a
tendency to win unless the conscious mind uses its power to
affect, use, control or harmonize with the powers of the
subconscious. You have the power to choose. Choose wisely —
with PMA. Transmute sex into virtue! Thus you will win over
one of the greatest problems you win ever have to face in your
personal life. And you will be physically, mentally, and morally
better.
117
And what are the seven virtues? Virtue is moral practice or
action, moral excellence; rectitude; valor; chastity. The seven
virtues are: prudence, fortitude, temperance, justice, faith, hope,
and charity.
1. Prudence — the ability to govern and discipline one's self
by the exercise of reason.
2. Fortitude — strength of mind that enables a person to
encounter danger or bear pain or adversity with courage. It is the
possession of the stamina essential to face that which repels
or frightens one, or to put up with the hardships of a task
imposed. It implies triumph. Synonyms are grit, backbone, pluck
and guts.
3. Temperance — habitual moderation in the indulgence of the
appetites and passions.
4. Justice — the principle or ideal of just dealing or right action;
also conformity to this principle or ideal; integrity.
5. Faith — trust in God.
6. Hope — the desire with expectation of obtaining what is
desired, or belief that it is obtainable.
7. Charity — the act of loving all men as brothers because they
are sons of God. It stresses benevolence and goodwill in giving
and in the broad understanding of others with kindly tolerance.
How can you transmute the power of sex into the good and
the beautiful? A crystal-clear answer can be found by you if you
search for it as you read and study this entire book. Results will
be achieved when you relate and assimilate the principles into
your own life.
118
But one must gain knowledge for himself. The following
suggestions may be helpful as you search for your answer while
reading:
1. Keep your mind on the things you want and off the things you
don't want. This means that you keep your mind on immediate,
intermediate, and distant desirable objectives. The instinct of sex
in the subconscious mind will be patient if it has hope that you
will fulfill life's mission. The boy or girl who is truly in love and
plans to marry will not have the sex problems he or she might
otherwise have.
2. If there were more and often earlier marriages, there would be
fewer sex problems. Life's mission to procreate is fulfilled in
marriage; however, marry for love beyond the sex instinct.
3. Lead a well-balanced, four-square life.
4. Work long hours at a labor of love. It will keep you busy,
occupy your thoughts, and use up surplus energy.
5. Develop a Magnificent Obsession. Study the significance to
be found in Chapter Fifteen.
6. Relate and assimilate into your own life the concepts in
Chapter Two, "You can Change Your World!" and Chapter
Seven, "Learn to See!"
7. Select environment that will develop you best towards
your objectives.
8. Choose the self-motivators for self-suggestion that you believe
will help you. Memorize them. Make they will flash from your
subconscious mind to your conscious mind as autosuggestion.
Not all the problems of one's personal life, however, are of so
deep and penetrating a nature. Many times all that it takes to meet
an immediate problem is quick thinking, adaptability, and taking
119
a second look at the situation which is causing the problem. It
often takes only one idea, followed by action, to turn failure into
success.
It takes only one idea, followed by action, to succeed when
others fail. In 1939 on Chicago's North Michigan Avenue, in an
area now known as The Magnificent Mile, office space was going
begging. Building after building had empty floors: one that was
half-rented was considered lucky. It was a bad year for business
and NMA hung over Chicago real estate like a cloud. You heard
such comments as, "No sense in advertising, there just isn't the
money around," or "What can you do? You can't fight the times."
Then into this gloomy picture came a building manager with
PMA. He had an idea. And he got into action!
This man was hired by Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Company to run a large building on North Michigan Avenue
which they had acquired in a mortgage foreclosure. When he took
the job the building was only ten per cent occupied. Within one
year it was 100 per cent rented, with a long waiting list. What
was the secret? The new manager accepted the problem of no-
demand-for-offices as a challenge rather than a misfortune. Here
is what he did as he explained in an interview.
I knew precisely what I wanted. I wanted to have the premises
100 per cent occupied with choice, substantial tenants. I knew
that under the prevailing conditions it was likely that the
offices would not be rented for possibly several years. I
therefore concluded that we had everything to gain and
nothing to lose by doing the following:
1. I would seek out desirable, prospective tenants of my choice.
2. I would stimulate the imagination of each prospect I would
offer him the most beautiful offices in the city of Chicago.
120
3. I would offer him these superior offices at a rental no higher
than the one he was now paying.
4. Furthermore, I would assume responsibility for his present
lease, provided he paid us the same monthly rental under a
one-year lease.
5. In addition to all this, I would offer redecoration without cost
to the tenant. I would employ creative architects and interior
decorators and remodel the offices of my building to suit the
personal taste of each new tenant.
I reasoned:
1. If an office were not rented during the next few years, we
would receive no income from that office. So we had
nothing to lose by going into such arrangements as are
above described. We might come out at the end of the year
with no income, but we would be no worse off than we
would have been if we had not acted. And we would be
better off because: we would have satisfied tenants who
would in future years   supply   dependable rentals.
2. Furthermore, it is an established custom to rent offices on
a one-year basis only. In most cases, there would be only a
few months left to run on the old lease of my new tenant.
Promising to assume these rentals was therefore not too
great a risk.
3. If a tenant should vacate at the end of his year, it would be
comparatively easy to re-rent in a well-filled building. The
redecoration of his office would not be money lost, as it
would have increased the equity value of the entire
building.
121
The result was marvelous. Each newly redecorated office
seemed to be more beautiful than the one that had preceded
it. The tenants were so enthused that many expended
additional sums. In one instance, a tenant spent an additional
$22,000 in remodeling.
So at the end of a year the building which had started off only
ten per cent rented was 100 percent rented. None of the
tenants wanted to leave after his lease expired. They were
happy with their new, ultramodern offices. And we gained
their permanent goodwill by not raising the rents at the
expiration of their first one-year's lease.
We would like you to think back over this story. Here was a man
faced with a most serious problem. He had a giant office building
on his hands that had nine empty offices in it for every one that
was occupied. And yet within a year, his building was 100 per
cent rented. Now right next door, up and down The Magnificent
Mile, there were dozens of office buildings standing idle and
practically empty.
The difference of course was the mental attitude which each
individual building manager brought to the problem. One man
said, "I have a problem. That's awful!" The other said, "I have a
problem. That's good!"
A man who seizes upon his problems as opportunities in disguise
and scrutinizes them for the good element that is going to be
there, is the man who understands the very core of PMA. The
man who develops an idea that can work and follows it with
action will turn failure into success.
Time after time the pattern repeats itself: problems and
difficulties turn out to be the best things that could have happened
to us —provided we translate them into advantages.
122
As you recognize, the problem which the building manager faced
occurred during the Depression. Things were still plenty tough in
1939 when he solved this problem. But they had been much
worse.
Now the economic problems of the nation and of the world arose
as the result of the Depression. Depressions are caused by cycles
in the economic life of a nation or nations. But it is not necessary
to sit idly by. There is no need to be beaten and tossed to and fro
by the cycles of life You can meet the problem of cycles and
conquer it intelligently. In so doing, you can often acquire a
fortune.
Make a fortune or achieve your aims by understanding cycles
and trends. Many years ago Paul Raymond, Vice President in
charge of loans for the American National Bank and Trust
Company of Chicago, rendered a service bank's customers. He
sent them Dewey and Dakin's book Cycles. Subsequently many
of these clients made fortunes. They learned and understood the
theory of business cycles and trends. Some of them will be
among those who won't lose the fortunes they acquired regardless
of economic trends and changes.
Edward R. Dewey, who has been the director for The Foundation
for the Study of Cycles for many years, points out that every
living organism, be it an individual, business, or nation, grows to
maturity, levels off, and dies. What is equally important, he
indicates a solution whereby, regardless of the trend or cycle,
you, as an individual, can do something about it. You can meet
the challenge of change successfully. You can change the trend as
far as you and your interests are concerned, regardless of the
general trend, with new life, new blood, new ideas, new activity.
He anticipated a downward cycle and prepared to go upward.
Before newspapers publicized the recession that began in the
123
latter part of 1957, one of the bank's clients got into action. His
organization went after business aggressively with a positive
mental attitude. In 1958 his company developed a premium
increase of over 30 per cent compared to the previous year which
had shown a 25 per cent increase. The entire industry, however,
had a downward trend.
Sometimes the cycle that presents a problem is not a cycle that
affects an industry, or an entire nation. It may be a cycle within
an individual business only. This problem, too, can be anticipated
and met. Witness the continual growth of many American
corporations, in spite of the fact that in the normal course of
events they would have grown to maturity, leveled off, and died.
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., is an outstanding example.
They met the challenge with new life, new blood, new ideas,
new activity. It is unnecessary to point out that E. I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co., Inc. has continued to grow. But what is the
cause of its success? Why has it not followed the natural cycle of
growing to maturity, leveling off, and dying?
Du Pont has met the challenge of change with new life, new
blood, new ideas, new activity. Its executives have met this
problem with PMA and the determination to overcome it. They
have continued to engage in research and are constantly making
new discoveries, developing new products, and perfecting their
previous products. They inject new blood into their management,
and study and improve their sales methods.
Learn from their success!
The owner of a small business, or you as an individual, can study
and experiment. You can relate and assimilate the principles used
by such a large corporation. You too can continue to grow with
booster shots of new ideas, new life, new blood, new activity.
124
You can change a downward trend into an upward one. You can
be different! When others float downstream, you can move
upstream!
So many of the stories you have read and will read in this book
indicate that "if you have a problem - that's good!" It's good if
you learn to see how to turn adversity into seeds of equivalent or
greater benefit. You may still not see the principle; however, the
next chapter entitled "Learn to See" can help you.

Thoughts to Steer By
1. So you've got a problem? That's good! Why? Because every
time you meet a problem and tackle and conquer it with PMA,
you become a better, bigger and more successful person.
2. Everyone has problems. Those with PMA turn their adversities
into seeds of equivalent or greater benefits.
3. Your success, or failure, in meeting the problems presented by
the challenges of change will be determined by your mental
attitude.
4. You can direct your thoughts, control your emotions and
ordain your destiny by recognizing, relating, assimilating and
applying the principles that are applicable to you to be found
in this book.
5. God is always a good God.
6. When you have a problem: (a) ask for Divine Guidance; (b)
think; (c) state the problem, and (d) analyze it; (e) adopt the
125
PMA attitude "That's good!" (f) then change the adversity into
seeds of greater benefit.
7. Charlie Ward is an outstanding example of a man who
successfully met the challenges of change. Prepare to meet
the challenges of change by developing PMA.
8. Sex is the greatest challenge of change. Transmute the emotion
of sex into virtue.
9. The seven virtues are: prudence, fortitude, temperance, justice,
faith, hope, and charity. Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude indicates how you can relate and assimilate these
qualities into your own life.
10. One good idea followed by action can change failure into
success.

CHAPTER 7
Learn to See
When he was born, George W. Campbell was blind. "Bilateral
congenital cataracts," the doctor called it.
George's father looked at the doctor, not wanting to believe. "Isn't
there anything you can do? Wouldn't an operation help?"
"No," said the doctor. "As of now, we know of no way to treat
this condition."
George Campbell couldn't see, but the love and faith of his
parents made his life rich. As a very young boy, he did not know
that he was missing anything.
And then, when George was six years old, something happened
which he wasn't able to understand. One afternoon he was
playing with another youngster. The other boy, forgetting that
George was blind, tossed a ball to him. "Look out! It'll hit you!"
The ball did hit George — and nothing in his life was quite the
same after that. George was not hurt, but he was greatly puzzled.
Later he asked his mother: "How could Bill know what's going to
happen to me before I know it?"
His mother sighed, for now the moment she dreaded had arrived.
Now it was necessary for her to tell her son for the first time:
"You are blind." And here is how she did it:
"Sit down, George," she said softly as she reached over and took
one of his hands. "I may not be able to describe it to you, and you
may not be able to understand, but let me try to explain it this
127
way." And sympathetically she took one of his little hands in hers
and started counting the fingers.
"One — two — three — four — five. These fingers are similar to
what is known as the five senses." She touched each finger
between her thumb and index finger in sequence as she continued
the explanation.
"This little finger for hearing; this little finger for touch; this little
finger for smell; this one for taste," and then she hesitated before
continuing: "this little finger for sight. And each of the five
senses, like each of the five fingers, sends messages to your
brain."
Then she closed the little finger which she had named "sight" and
tied it so that it would stay next to the palm of George's hand.
"George, you are different from other boys," she explained,
"because you have the use of only four senses, like four fingers:
one, hearing — two, touch — three, smell — and four, taste. But
you don't have the use of your sense of sight. Now I want to show
you something. Stand up," she said gently.
George stood up. His mother picked up his ball. "Now hold out
your hand as if you were going to catch this," she said.
George held out his hands, and in a moment he felt the hard ball
hit his fingers. He closed them tightly around it and caught it.
"Fine. Fine," said his mother. "I never want you to forget what
you have just done. You can catch a ball with four fingers instead
of five, George. You can also catch and hold a full and happy life
with four senses instead of five — if you get in there and keep
trying." Now George's mother had used a metaphor, and such a
128
simple figure of speech is one of the quickest and most effective
methods of communicating ideas between persons.
George never forgot the symbol of "four fingers instead of five."
It meant to him the symbol of hope. And whenever he became
discouraged because of his handicap, he used the symbol as a
self-motivator. It became a form of self-suggestion to him. For he
would repeat "four fingers instead of five" frequently. At times of
need it would flash from his subconscious to his conscious mind.
And he found that his mother was right. He was able to catch a
full life, and hold it with the use of the four senses which he did
have.
But George Campbell's story doesn't end here.
In the middle of his junior year at high school the boy became ill,
and it was necessary for him to go to the hospital. While George
was convalescing, his father brought him information from which
he learned that science had developed a cure for congenital
cataracts. Of course, there was a chance of failure but — the
chances for success far outweighed those for failure.
George wanted so much to see that he was willing to risk failure
in order to see.
During the next six months four delicate surgical operations were
performed — two on each eye. For days George lay in the
darkened hospital room with bandages over his eyes.
And finally the day came for the bandages to be removed.
Slowly, carefully, the doctor unwound the gauze from around
George's head and over his eyes. There was only a blur of light.
George Campbell was still technically blind!
129
For one awful moment he lay thinking. And then he heard the
doctor moving beside his bed. Something was being placed over
his eyes.
"Now, can you see?" came the doctor's question.
George raised his head slightly from the pillow. The blur of light
became color, the color a form, a figure.
"George!" a voice said. He recognized the voice. It was his
mother's voice.
For the first time in his 18 years of life George Campbell was
seeing his mother. There were the tired eyes, the wrinkled, 62-
year-old face, and the knotted and gnarled hands. But to George
she was most beautiful.
To him — she was an angel. The years of toil and patience, the
years of teaching and planning, the years of being his seeing eyes,
the love and affection: that was what George saw.
To this day he treasures his first visual picture: the sight of his
mother. And, as you will see, he learned an appreciation for his
sense of sight from this first experience.
"None of us can understand," he says, "the miracle of sight,
unless we have had to do without it."
Seeing is a learned process. But George also learned something
that is very helpful to anyone interested in the study of PMA. He
will never forget the day he saw his mother standing before him
in the hospital room, and did not know who she was — or even
what she was — until he heard her speak. "What we see," George
points out, "is always an interpretation of the mind. We have to
train the mind to interpret what we see."
130
This observation is backed up by science. "Most of the process of
seeing is not done by the eyes at all," says Dr. Samuel Renshaw,
in describing the mental process of seeing. "The eyes act as hands
which reach 'out there' and grab meaningless 'things' and bring
them into the brain. The brain then turns the 'things' over to the
memory. It is not until the brain interprets in terms of com-
parative action that we really see anything."
Some of us go through life "seeing" very little of the power and
the glory around us. We do not properly filter the information that
our eyes give us through the mental processes of the brain. As a
result we often behold things without really seeing them at all.
We receive physical impressions without grasping their meaning
to us. We do not, in other words, put PMA to work on the
impressions that are sent to our brain.
Is it time to have your mental vision checked? Not your physical
vision — that is a matter for the medical specialists. But mental
vision, like physical vision, can become distorted. When it does
you can grope in a haze of false concepts... bumping and hurting
yourself and others unnecessarily.
The most common physical weaknesses of the eye are two
opposite extremes — nearsightedness and farsightedness. These
are the major distortions of mental vision, too.
The person who is mentally nearsighted is apt to over-look
objects and possibilities that are distant. He pays attention only to
the problems immediately at hand and is blind to the
opportunities that could be his by thinking and planning in terms
of the future. You are nearsighted if you do not make plans, form
objectives, and lay the foundation for the future.
On the other hand, the mentally farsighted person is apt to
overlook possibilities that are right before him. He does not see
131
the opportunities at hand. He sees only a dream-world of the
future, unrelated to the present. He wants to start at the top rather
than move up step by step — and he does not recognize that the
only job where you can start at the top is the job of digging a
hole.
They looked and recognized what they saw. So, in the process
of learning to see, you will want to develop both your near sight
and your far sight. The advantages to the man who knows how to
see what is directly in front of him are enormous. For years the
people in the little town of Darby, Montana, used to look up at
what they called Crystal Mountain. The mountain was given this
name because erosion had exposed a ledge of a lightly sparkling
crystal that looked something like rock salt. A pack trail was built
directly across the outcropping as early as 1937. But it wasn't
until the year 1951 — 14 years later — that anyone bothered to
stoop down, pick up a piece of the sparkling material, and really
look at it.
It was in this year 1951 that two Darby men, Mr. A. E. Cumley
and Mr. L. I. Thompson, saw a mineral collection displayed in
the town. Thompson and Cumley became very excited. There in
the mineral display were specimens of beryl which, according to
the attached card, was used in atomic energy research.
Immediately Thompson and Cumley staked claims on Crystal
Mountain. Thompson sent a specimen of the ore to the Bureau of
Mines office in Spokane, together with a request to send an
examiner to see a "very large deposit" of the mineral. Later that
year the Bureau of Mines sent a bulldozer up the mountain and
scraped off enough of the outcropping to determine that here
indeed was one of the world's greatest deposits of extremely
valuable beryllium. Today, heavy earth-moving trucks struggle
up the mountain and work their way back down again, weighted
down with the extremely heavy ore, while at the bottom, virtually
waiting with dollar bills in their hands, are representatives of the
132
United States Steel Company and the United States Government,
each anxious to buy the highly valued ore. All because one day
two young men not only observed with their eyes, but took the
trouble to see with their minds. Today these men are well on their
way to being multimillionaires.
A mentally farsighted person could not have done what
Thompson and Cumley did — if his mental vision were distorted.
For he is the man who can see only far-off values while the
advantages that lie at his feet go un-claimed. Are there fortunes
right at your doorstep? Look about you. As you go about your
daily chores are there small areas of irritation? Perhaps you can
think of a way to overcome them — a way that will be helpful not
only to yourself but to others. Many a man has made a fortune by
meeting such homely needs. This was so of the man who
invented the bobby pin and the one who devised the paper clip. It
was so of the man who invented the zipper, and the metal pants-
fastener. Look about you. Learn to see. You may find Acres of
Diamonds in your own backyard.
But mental nearsightedness can be just as much of a problem as
mental farsightedness. The man with this problem sees only what
is under his nose, while more distant possibilities go unclaimed.
He is the man who does not understand the power of a plan. He
does not understand the value of thinking time. He is so busy
with the problems that immediately confront him that he does not
free his mind to range into the distance, reaching for new
opportunities, seeking trends, getting the big picture.
Being able to see into the future is one of the most spectacular
accomplishments of the human brain. Down in the heart of the
citrus belt in Florida there is a little town called Winter Haven.
The surrounding country is farmland. Certainly it would be
considered by most people as an area entirely unsuited for a large
tourist attraction. It is isolated. It has no beach, no mountains,
133
only mile after mile of gently rolling hills with little lakes and
cypress swamps down in the valleys.
But to this region came a man who "saw" these cypress swamps
with an eye that others had not used. His name was Richard Pope.
Dick Pope bought one of these old cypress swamps, put a fence
around it, and has turned down offers of at least a million dollars
for the world-famous Cypress Gardens.
Of course, it really wasn't as simple as that. All along the line
Dick Pope had to "see" opportunities in his situation.
For instance, there was the question of advertising. Pope knew
that the only way he would be able to draw the public into such
an isolated place was through a barrage of advertising. But ads
cost money. So what Dick Pope did was quite simple. He went
into the popular photography business. He set up a photo supply
house at Cypress Gardens, sold his visitors film and then taught
them how to take spectacular shots of the Garden. He hired
skilled water skiers. He put them through intricate performances
while over a loudspeaker he announced to the public exactly what
camera settings they should use in order to catch the action. And
then, of course, when these travelers went back home, the very
best trip pictures were always of Cypress Gardens. They gave
Dick Pope the very best kind of advertising there is — word-of-
mouth recommendations, with pictures!
This is the kind of creative seeing that we all need to develop. We
need to learn how to look at our world with fresh eyes — seeing
the opportunities that lie all about us, but simultaneously looking
into the future for the chances that are there.
Seeing is a learned skill. But like any skill it must be exercised.
134
See another person's abilities, capacities and viewpoint. We
may think we recognize our own talents; yet in this respect we
may be blind. Let's illustrate with an example of a teacher who
needed to have her mental vision checked. She was both
nearsighted and farsighted. For she could not see either the
present or the future potential abilities and capacities of her
students, or their points of view.
Now everyone — the great and the near great — had to have a
starting point. They weren't born brilliant and successful. As a
matter of fact, some of our greatest men were regarded as quite
stupid at times during their lives. It was not until they grasped a
positive mental attitude and learned to comprehend their
capabilities and envision definite goals that they started their
climbs to success. But there was one young man, in particular,
whom his teachers thought "a stupid, muddle-headed blockhead."
The youngster sat and drew pictures on his slate. He looked about
and listened to everybody else. He asked "impossible questions"
but refused to reveal what he knew, even under the threat of
punishment. The children called him "dunce," and he generally
stood at the foot of his class.
And this boy was Thomas Alva Edison. You will be inspired
when you read the life story of Thomas A. Edison. He attended
primary school for a total period of less than three months. The
teacher and his schoolmates told him that he was stupid. Yet, he
became an educated man after an incident in his life prompted
him to turn his talisman from NMA to PMA. He developed into a
gifted person. He became a great inventor.
What was that incident? What happened to Edison that changed
his whole attitude? He told his mother about hearing the teacher
tell the inspector at school that he was "addled" and it wouldn't be
worthwhile  to  keep  him in  school  any  longer.  His  mother
135
marched off to school with him and told all within range of her
voice that her son, Thomas Alva Edison, had more brains than the
teacher or the inspector.
Edison called his mother the most enthusiastic champion a boy
ever had. And from that day forward he was a changed boy. He
said, "She cast over me an influence which has lasted all my life.
The good effects of her early training I can never lose. My
mother was always kind, always sympathetic, and she never
misunderstood or misjudged me." His mother's belief in him
caused him to view himself in an entirely different light. It caused
him to turn his talisman to PMA and take a positive mental
attitude regarding studying and learning. This attitude taught
Edison to view things with deeper mental insight, that enabled
him to comprehend and develop inventions which benefited
mankind. Perhaps the teacher didn't see because the teacher
wasn't genuinely interested in helping the boy. His mother was.
You have a tendency to see what you want to see.
To hear does not necessarily imply attention or application. To
listen always does. Throughout Success Through a Positive
Mental Attitude we urge you to listen to the message. This means:
to see how you can relate and assimilate the principle into your
own life.
Perhaps you'd like to see how you can relate the principle of the
following experience into your own life:
Dr. Roy Plunkett, a DuPont chemist, made an experiment. He
failed. When he opened the test tube after the experiment, he
observed that it apparently contained nothing. He was curious. He
asked himself, "Why?" He didn't throw the tube away as others
might have done under similar circumstances. Instead, he
weighed the tube. And, to his surprise, it weighed more than a
136
tube of like make and design. So, again, Dr. Plunkett asked
himself, "Why?"
In searching for the answer to his questions, he discovered that
marvelous transparent plastic, tetrafluoroethylene, commonly
known as Teflon. During the Korean War, the United States
government contracted for Du Pont's entire output.
When there is something you don't understand, ask yourself:
"Why?" Look at it more closely. You may make a great
discovery.
Ask yourself questions. Asking yourself or others questions
about things that puzzle you may reward you richly. This very
procedure led to one of the world's greatest scientific discoveries.
A young Englishman, while vacationing on his grandmother's
farm, was relaxing. He was lying on his back under an apple tree
and engaging in thinking time. An apple fell to the ground. This
young man was a student of higher mathematics.
"Why does the apple fall to the ground?" he asked himself. "Does
the earth attract the apple? Does the apple attract the earth? Does
each attract the other? What is the universal principle involved?"
Isaac Newton used his power to think and he made a discovery.
To see mentally is to think. He found the answers he was looking
for; the earth and the apple attracted each other, and the law of
attraction of mass to mass applies to the entire universe.
Newton discovered the law of gravitation because he was
observant and sought the answers to what he observed. Another
man, because he exercised his powers of observation and acted
upon what he perceived, found happiness  and great wealth.
137
Newton asked himself questions. The other man sought expert
advice.
He became wealthy because he accepted advice. In Toba,
Japan, in the year 1869, when he was just eleven years old,
Kokichi Mikimoto continued his father's business as the village
noodle maker. His father had developed an illness that prevented
him from working. The youngster supported his six brothers,
three sisters, and his parents. In addition to making the noodles
daily, young Mikimoto had to sell them. He proved to be a good
salesman.
Mikimoto had previously been tutored by a Samurai who taught:
Exemplification of true faith consists of acts ofkind-ness and love
for one's fellowmen, not mere formal prayers uttered by rote.
And with this basic PMA philosophy of positive action,
Mikimoto became a doer. He developed the habit of converting
ideas into reality.
At the age of twenty he fell in love with the daughter of a
Samurai. The young man knew that his future father-in-law
would not bless his daughter's marriage with a noodle maker.
Therefore, he was motivated to harmonize with this known
power. He changed his occupation and became a pearl merchant.
Like many persons who achieve success in any part of the world,
Mikimoto kept searching for specific knowledge that would help
him in his new activity. He, like the great industrialists of our
day, sought help from a university. Professor Yoshikichi
Mizukuri told Mikimoto of a theory of one of the laws of nature
that had never been proved.
138
The professor said: "A pearl is formed in an oyster when a
foreign object, like a grain of sand, is stuck in the oyster. If the
foreign object does not kill the oyster, nature covers the object
with the same secretion that forms the mother-of-pearl in the
lining of the oyster's shell."
Mikimoto was thrilled! He could hardly wait to get the answer to
the question he asked himself, "Can I raise? pearls by deliberately
planting a tiny foreign object in the oyster and letting nature take
its course?"
He converted a theory into a positive action once he learned to
see.
Mikimoto had been taught to see by that university professor.
And then he used the power of his imagination. He engaged in
creative thinking. He used deductive reasoning. He decided that if
all pearls were formed only when a foreign object entered the
oyster, he could develop pearls by using nature's laws. He
could plant foreign objects in the oysters and force them to
produce pearls. He learned to observe and act and he became a
successful man.
Now a study of Mikimoto's life indicates that he employed all
the 17 success principles. For knowledge doesn't make you
successful. But application of the knowledge will. Action!
Many of the ideas which come to us as we learn to see with
fresh eyes will strike others as bold. These ideas can either
frighten us or, if we act on them, make our fortunes. Here is
another true story of pearls. This time the hero is a young
American, Joseph Goldstone. He sold jewelry to Iowa farmers,
door-to-door.
139
Then one day in the heart of the Depression he learned that the
Japanese were producing beautiful cultured pearls. Here was
quality, and it could be sold at a fraction of the cost of natural
pearls!
Joe "saw" a great opportunity. In spite of the fact that it was a
Depression year, he and his wife, Esther, converted all their
tangible assets into cash and set out for Tokyo. They landed in
Japan with less than $1000 — but they had their plan and lots of
PMA.
They obtained an interview with Mr. K. Kitamura, head of the
Japanese Pearl Dealers Association. Joe was aiming high. He told
Mr. Kitamura of his plan for merchandising Japanese cultured
pearls in the United States, and asked Mr. Kitamura for an initial
credit of $100,000 in pearls. This was a fantastic sum, especially
in a period of depression. After several days, however, Mr.
Kitamura agreed.
The pearls sold well. The Goldstones were well on their way to
becoming wealthy. A few years later, they decided they wanted to
establish their own pearl farm, which they did with the help of
Mr. Kitamura. Once again they "saw" opportunity where others
had seen nothing. Experience proved that the mortality rate of
oysters into which a foreign object had been artificially inserted
was over 50 per cent.
"How can we eliminate this great loss?" they asked themselves.
After much study, the Goldstones began to use on the oysters the
methods employed in hospital rooms. The outside shells were
scraped and scrubbed to reduce the danger of infection to the
oyster. The "surgeon" used a liquid anesthetic that relaxed the
oyster. Then he slipped a tiny clam pellet into each oyster as a
nucleus for the pearl that was to be formed. The incision was
140
made with a sterilized scalpel. Then the oyster was put into a
cage, and the cage was dropped back into the water. Every four
months cages were raised and the oysters were given a physical
checkup. Through these techniques, 90 per cent of the oysters
lived and developed pearls, and the Goldstones went on to
acquire a fabulous fortune.
Time and again we see how men and women have become
successful after they learned to apply mental perception. The
ability to see is much more than the physical process of taking
light rays through the retina of the eye. It is the skill of
interpreting what you see and applying that interpretation to your
life and the lives of others.
Learning to see will bring to you opportunities that you never
dreamed existed. However, there is more to success through
PMA than learning mental perception. You must also learn to act
on what you learn. Action is important because through action
you get things done.
Don't wait any longer. Read The Secret of Getting Things Done in
the next chapter and move another rung up the ladder of success
through PMA.
PILOT NO. 7
Thoughts to Steer By
1. Learn to see! Seeing is a learned process. Nine-tenths of
seeing takes place in the brain.
2. Four fingers instead of five: this was the symbol whereby
George Campbell, the blind boy, could catch and hold a full
and happy life. How can you use this symbol?
141
3. Seeing is learned through association. George Campbell's
first sight of his mother became meaningful to him only
when he recognized her voice.
4. Is it time to have your mental vision checked? when it is
distorted, you can grope around in a haze of false concepts,
bumping and hurting yourself and others unnecessarily.
Does your mental vision become clearer year by year?
5. Take a look — & good look — and recognize what you see.
There may be Acres of Diamonds in your own backyard!
6. Don't be nearsighted — look to the future. Cypress Gardens
became a reality because Richard Pope saw it as a definite
future objective.
7. See another person's abilities, capacities, and viewpoint.
You may be overlooking a genius. The story of Thomas
Edison is a good example.
8. Do you see how you can relate and assimilate the principles
of Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude into your own
life?
9. Learn from nature. How? Ask yourself some questions, as
Isaac Newton did. If you don't know the answers, get expert
advice.
10. Convert what you see into reality by action. Mikimoto
converted a theory into a fortune in pearls. Goldstone
recognized, related and applied the principles and methods
used in hospitals to save human lives as being applicable to
saving the lives of oysters in producing cultured pearls.

CHAPTER 8
The Secret of Getting
Things Done
In this chapter you will find the secret of getting things done. You
will also receive a self-motivator so powerful that it will
subconsciously force you to desirable action, for it is in reality a
self-starter. Yet you can use it at will. When you do, you
overcome procrastination and inertia.
If you do the things you don't want to do, or if you don't do the
things that you do want to do, then this chapter is for you.
Those who achieve greatness employ this secret of getting things
done. Take, for example, Maryknoll Father James Keller. Father
Keller had been developing an idea for quite some time. He
hoped to motivate "little people to do big things by encouraging
each to reach beyond his or her own little circle to the outside
world." The Biblical command, "go ye forth into all the world"
was to him the symbol of an idea whereby the mission he had in
mind could be fulfilled.
When he responded to this command, he employed the secret of
getting things done. And when he did, he went into action. This
happened in 1945. It was then that he organized the Christophers
— an organization most unusual.
It has no chapters, no committees, no meetings, no dues. It
doesn't even have a membership in the usual sense of the word. It
simply consists of people — no one can say how many —
dedicated to an ideal. The Christophers operate on the concept
that it is better for people to "do something and pay nothing" than
to "pay dues and do nothing."
143
What is the ideal to which each is dedicated?
Each Christopher is dedicated to carry his religion with him
wherever he goes throughout the day — into the dust and heat of
the market place, into the highways and byways, into the home.
And thus he brings the major truths of his faith to others.
The thrilling story is told by the Rev. James Keller in You Can
Change the World. It came about because he conceived and
believed in an ideal. But he did little or nothing about it until he
responded to the secret of getting things done.
You get the feel of this secret from the statement of E. E.
Bauermeister, supervisor of education and correctional counselor
at California Institution for Men, Chino, California, who told the
authors:
"I always tell the men in our self-adjustment class that too often
what we read and profess becomes a part of our libraries and our
vocabularies, instead of becoming a part of our lives."
Remember the Biblical statement: For the good that I would, I do
not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now how can you
train yourself to get into action immediately when it is desirable?
And then we told Mr. Bauermeister how the good things we read
and profess can become a part of our lives. We gave him the self-
starter for getting things done.
How do you make the secret of getting things done a part of your
life? By habit. And you develop habit through repetition. "Sow
an action and you reap a habit; sow a habit and you reap a
character; sow a character and you reap a destiny," said the great
psychologist and philosopher William James. He was saying that
you are what your habits make you. And you can choose your
144
habits. You can develop any habit you wish when you use the
self-starter.
Now what is the secret of getting things done and what is the self-
starter that forces you to use this great secret?
The secret of getting things done is to act The self-starter is the
self-motivator DO IT NOW!
As long as you live, never say to yourself, "DO IT NOW!" unless
you follow through with desirable action. Whenever action is
desirable and the symbol DO IT NOW! flashes from your
subconscious mind to your conscious mind, immediately act.
Make it a practice to respond to me self-starter DO IT NOW! in
little things. You will quickly develop the habit of a reflex
response so powerful that in times of emergency or when
opportunity presents itself, you will act. Say you have a phone
call that you should make but you have a tendency to
procrastinate. And you have put off making that phone call.
When the self-starter DO IT NOW! flashes from your
subconscious to your conscious mind: Act. Make that phone call
immediately.
Or suppose, for example, that you set your alarm clock for 6:00
A.M. Yet when the alarm goes off, you feel sleepy, get up, turn
off the alarm, and go back to bed. You will have a tendency to
develop a habit to do the same thing in the future. But if your
subconscious mind flashes to the conscious DO IT NOW! then
come what may — DO IT NOW! Stay up! Why? You want to de-
velop the habit of responding to the self-starter DO IT NOW!
In Chapter Thirteen you will read how one of the authors bought
a company with one million six hundred thousand dollars in net
liquid assets with the seller's own money. This became a reality
145
because at the proper time the buyer responded to the self-starter
DO IT NOW!
Now H. G. Wells learned the secret of getting things done. And
H. G. Wells was a prolific writer because he did. He tried never
to let a good idea slip away from him. While an idea was fresh,
he immediately wrote down the thought that occurred to him.
This would sometimes happen in the middle of the night. No
matter. Wells would switch on the light, reach for the pencil and
paper that were always beside his bed and scribble away. And
then he would drop off to sleep again.
Ideas that might have been forgotten were recalled when he
refreshed his memory by looking at the flashes of inspiration that
had been written down immediately when they occurred. This
habit of Wells' was as natural and effortless to him as smiling is
to you when a happy thought occurs.
Many persons have the habit of procrastination. Because of it,
they may miss a train, be late for work, or even more important
— miss an opportunity that could change the whole course of
their lives for the better. History has recorded how battles have
been lost someone put off taxing desirable action.
New students in our PMA Science of Success course sometimes
state that the procrastination habit is the one they would like to
eliminate. And then we reveal to them the secret of getting things
done. We give them the self-starter. We may motivate them by
telling them the true story of what the self-starter meant to a war
prisoner in World War II.
What the self-starter meant to a war prisoner. Kenneth Erwin
Harmon was a civilian employee for the Navy at Manila when the
Japanese landed there. He was captured and held in a hotel for
two days before he was sent to a prison camp.
146
On the first day, Kenneth saw that his roommate had a book
under his pillow. "May I borrow it?" he asked. The book was
Think and Grow Rich. Kenneth began to read. As he read, he met
the most important living person with the invisible talisman
imprinted with PMA on one side and NMA on the reverse.
Before he started to read it, he had the feeling of despair. He
fearfully looked ahead to possible torture-even death — in the
prison camp. But now as he read his attitude became one inspired
by hope. He had a craving to own the book. He wanted it with
him during the dread days ahead. In discussing Think and Grow
Rich with his fellow prisoner, he realized that the book meant a
great deal to the owner.
"Let me copy it," he said.
"Sure, go ahead," was the response.
Kenneth Harmon employed the secret of getting things done. He
swung into immediate action. In a fury of activity he began
typing away. Word by word, page by page, chapter by chapter.
Because he was obsessed with the possibility that it would be
taken away at any moment, he was motivated to work night and
day.
It was a good thing that he did for within an hour after the last
page was completed, his captors led him away to the notorious
Santo Tomas prison camp. He had finished in time because he
started in time. Kenneth Harmon kept the manuscript with him
during the three years and one month he was a prisoner. He read
it again and again. And it gave him food for thought. It inspired
him to: develop courage, make plans for the future, and retain his
mental and physical health Many prisoners at Santo Tomas were
permanently injured physically and mentally by malnutrition and
fear — fear of the present and fear of the future. "But I was better
when I left Santo Tomas than when I was interned — better
147
prepared for life — more mentally alert," Kenneth Harmon told
us. You get the feel of his thinking in his statement: "Success
must be continually practiced, or it will take wings and fly away."
Now is the time to act.
For the secret of getting things done can change a person's
attitude from negative to positive. A day that might have been
ruined can become a pleasant day.
The day that might have been wasted. Jorgen Juhldahl, a
student at the University of Copenhagen, worked one summer as
a tourist guide. Because he cheerfully did much more than he was
paid to do, some visitors from Chicago made arrangements for
him to tour America. The itinerary included a day of sightseeing
in Washington, D. C, while he was en route to Chicago.
On arriving in Washington, Jorgen checked in at the Willard
Hotel, where his bill had been pre-paid. He was sitting on top of
the world. In his coat pocket was his lane ticket to Chicago; in his
hip pocket was his wallet with his passport and money. Then the
young man was dealt a shocking blow!
While getting ready for bed, he found that his wallet was missing.
He ran downstairs to the hotel desk.
"We'll do everything we can," said the manager.
But the next morning the wallet had still not been located. Jorgen
Juhldahl had less than two dollars change in his pockets. Alone in
a foreign country, he wondered what he should do. Wire his
friends in Chicago and tell them what had happened? Go to the
Danish embassy and report the lost passport? Sit at police
headquarters until they had some news?
148
Then, all of a sudden, he said: "No! I won't do any of these
things! I'll see Washington. I may never be here again. I have one
precious day in this great capital. After all, I still have my ticket
to get me to Chicago tonight, and there'll be plenty of time then to
solve the problem of the money and the passport. But if I don't
see Washington now I may never see it. I've walked miles at
home, I'll enjoy walking here.
"Now is the time to be happy.
"I am the same man that I was yesterday before I lost my wallet. I
was happy then, I should be happy now — just to be in America
— just to have the privilege of enjoying a holiday in this great
city.
"I won't waste my time in futile unhappiness over my   loss."
And so he headed off, on foot. He saw the White House and the
Capitol, he visited the great museums, he climbed to the top of
the Washington Monument. He wasn't able to take the tour of
Arlington and some other places he'd wanted to see. But what he
did see, he saw more thoroughly. He bought peanuts and candy
and nibbled on them to keep from getting too hungry.
And when he got back to Denmark, the part of his American trip
he remembered best was that day on foot in Washington — a day
that might have gotten away from Jorgen Juhldahl if he had not
employed the secret of getting things done. For he knew the truth
in the statement. NOW is the time. He knew that NOW must be
seized before it becomes: yesterday-I-could-have...
Incidentally, to round off his story, five days after that eventful
day Washington police found both wallet and passport and sent
them to him.
149
Are you scared of your own best ideas? One of the things that
often prevents us from seizing the NOW is a certain timidity in
the face of our own inspirations. We're a little bit afraid of our
ideas when they first occur to us. They may seem novel or
farfetched. There's no doubt about it: It takes a certain boldness to
step out on an untested idea. Yet it's exactly this kind of boldness
that often produces the most spectacular results. The well-known
writer, Elsie Lee, tells about Ruth Butler and her sister Eleanor,
the daughters of a nationally-known New York furrier.
"My father was a frustrated painter," says Ruth, "He had talent,
but the need to earn a living left him no time to build a reputation
as an artist. So he collected painting. Later, he started buying
paintings for Eleanor and me. Thus, the girls developed a
knowledge and appreciation fine art, along with an impeccable
sense of taste. As they grew older, friends would consult them on
what types of paintings they should buy for their homes. Often
they would loan pieces from their collection for brief periods.
One day Eleanor woke Ruth up at 3 A.M. "Don't start arguing,
but I have a terrific idea! We're going to form a Master Mind
alliance."
"Now what in the world is a Master Mind alliance?" Ruth asked.
"A Master Mind alliance is coordination of knowledge and effort,
in a spirit of harmony, between two or more people, for the
attainment of a definite purpose. And that's just what we're going
to do. We're going into the business of renting paintings!"
And Ruth agreed. It was a terrific idea. They set to work the same
day — although friends tried to warn them of dangers: Their
valued paintings might be lost or stolen; and there might be law
suits and insurance problems. But they went right on working —
150
accumulating $300 in capital and talking their father into loaning
them the basement of his fur shop, rent free.
"We hauled 1,800 paintings from our own collections in among
the coat forms," Ruth recalls, "and ignored father's sad and
disapproving eyes. The first year was grim — a real struggle."
But the novel idea paid off. Their company, known as the New
York Circulating Library of Paintings, became a success — with
about 500 paintings constantly on rental to business firms,
doctors, lawyers and for use in homes. One valued client was an
inmate of the Massachusetts Penitentiary for eight years. He
wrote humbly that perhaps the Library wouldn't rent to him,
considering his address. The paintings went to him rent free
except for transportation costs. In return Ruth and Eleanor
received a letter from prison authorities telling how the paintings
were used in an art appreciation course that benefited many
hundreds of prisoners. Ruth and Eleanor started their business
with an idea. And then they backed their idea up with immediate
action. The results were a profit to themselves and increased
pleasure and happiness for many others.
Are you ready to double your income? W. Clement Stone toured
the Asiatic and Pacific areas as one of seven executives serving
as representatives of the National Sales Executives International.
On a Tuesday, Stone gave a talk on motivation to a group of
businessmen at Melbourne, Australia. The following Thursday
evening, he received a phone call. It was from Edwin H. East,
manager of a firm that sold metal cabinets. Mr. East was excited:
"Something wonderful has happened! You'll be as enthusiastic as
I am when I tell you about it!"
"Tell me about it. What did happen?"
151
"An amazing thing! You gave your talk on motivation Tuesday.
In your talk you recommended ten inspirational books. I bought
Think and Grow Rich and started to read it that evening. I read for
hours. The next morning I started reading it again and then I
wrote on a piece of paper:
"My major definite aim is to double last year's sales this year.
The amazing thing is: I did it in forty-eight hours."
"How did you do it?" Mr. Stone asked East. "How did you double
your income?"
East responded: "In your speech on motivation, you told how Al
Allen, one of your Wisconsin salesmen, tried to sell cold-canvass
in a certain block. You said that Al was lucky because he worked
all day and didn't make a sale.
"That evening, you said, Al Allen developed inspirational
dissatisfaction. He determined that the following day he would
again call on exactly the same prospects and sell more insurance
policies that day than any of the other representatives in his group
would sell all week.
"You told how Al Allen completely canvassed the same city
block. He called on the same people and sold 66 new accident
contracts. I remembered your statement: 'It can't be done some
may think, but — Al did it.' I believed you. I was ready.
"I remembered the self-starter you gave us: DO IT NOW!
"I went to my card records and analyzed ten 'dead' accounts. I
prepared what might previously have seemed to be an enormous
program to present to each. I repeated the self-starter DO IT
NOW! several times. And then I called on the ten accounts with a
positive mental attitude and made eight large sales. It is amazing
152
— truly amazing — what PMA will do for the salesmen who use
its power!"
Now Edwin H. East was ready when he heard the talk on
motivation. He listened to the message that was applicable to
him. He was searching for something. And he found what he was
looking for. Our purpose in relating this particular story is that
you, too, have read about Al Allen. But you may not have seen
how you could apply the principle to your own experience.
Edwin H. East did. And you can, too. You can apply the
principles in each of the stories you read in Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude.
Now, however, we want you to learn the self-starter, DO IT
NOW!
Sometimes a decision to act immediately can make your wildest
dreams come true. It worked that way for Manley Sweazey.
You can mix business and pleasure. Manley loved hunting and
fishing. His idea of the good life was to hike fifty miles into the
woods with his pole and his rifle, and hike back a couple of days
later exhausted, muddy, and very happy.
The only trouble with this hobby was that it took too much time
out from his work as an insurance salesman. Then one day as he
reluctantly left a favorite bass lake and headed back to his desk,
Manley had a wild idea. Suppose, somewhere, there were people
living in a wilderness — people who needed insurance. Then he
could work and be out-of-doors at the same time! And indeed,
Manley discovered, there was such a group of people: The men
who worked for the Alaska Railroad. They lived in scattered
section-houses strung out along the 500-mile length of the track.
What if he were to sell insurance to these railroad men, and to the
trappers and gold miners along the route?
153
The same day that the idea came to him, Sweazey began making
positive plans. He consulted a travel agent and began packing. He
didn't pause to let doubts creep in and frighten him into believing
that his idea might be scatterbrained... that it might fail. Instead
of picking the idea apart for its flaws, he took a boat to Seward,
Alaska.
He walked the length of the railroad many, many "Walking
Sweazey," as he was called, became a welcome sight to these
isolated families, not only because sold insurance when no one
else had thought them worth bothering with, but because he
represented the outside world. He went the extra mile. For he
taught himself how to cut hair, and did it free of charge. He
taught himself how to cook, too. Since the single men ate mostly
canned foods and bacon, Manley, with his culinary skills, was a
welcome guest. And all the while he was doing what came
naturally. He was doing what he wanted to do: tramping the hills,
hunting, fishing and — as he puts it, "living the life of Sweazey!"
In the life insurance business there is a special place of honor
reserved for men who sell over a million dollars worth of
business in one year. It is called the Million Dollar Round Table.
Now the remarkable and almost unbelievable part of Manley
Sweazey's story is that: having acted on his impulse, having taken
off for the wilds of Alaska, having walked the railroad where no
one else had bothered to go, he did his million dollars of
business, and more, in a single year, to take his place at the
Round Table.
And none of it would have happened if he had hesitated to
employ the secret of getting things done when his "wild" idea
came to him.
Memorize the self-starter DO IT NOW!
154
DO IT NOW! can affect every phase of your life. It can help you
do the things you should do, but don't feel like doing. It can keep
you from procrastinating when an unpleasant duty faces you. But
it can also help you as it did Manley Sweazey, to do those things
that you want to do. It helps you seize those precious moments
which, if lost, may never be retrieved. The endearing word to a
friend, for example. The telephone call to an associate, just telling
him that you admire him. All in response to the self-starter DO IT
NOW!
Write yourself a letter. Here is an idea to help you get started. Sit
down and write yourself a letter, telling the things you always
intended to do as though they had already been accomplished —
some personal, some charitable, and others community projects.
Write the letter as if a biographer were writing about the
wonderful person you really are when you come under the
influence of PMA. But don't stop there. Use the secret of getting
things done. Respond to the self-starter DO IT NOW!
Remember, regardless of what you have been or what you are,
you can be what you want to be if you act with PMA.
The self-starter DO IT NOW! is an important self-motivator. It is
the important step towards understanding and applying the
principles of the next chapter entitled, "How to Motivate
Yourself."
PILOT NO. 8
Thoughts to Steer By
1. It is better for people to do something and pay nothing, than to
pay dues and do nothing.
2. "Too often what we read and profess becomes a part of our
libraries and our vocabularies, instead of becoming a part of
155
our lives." Stop and think about this. You have knowledge of
principles that could help you achieve any worthwhile goal in
life you might desire — but do you make these principles a
part of your life?
3. "Sow an action and you reap a habit; sow a habit and you reap
a character; sow a character and you reap a destiny." What
habits of thought or action, in any human activity, would you
like to acquire? What habits would you like to eliminate? You
should know how to acquire desirable habits and eliminate the
undesirable if you have learned how to recognize principles
revealed to you in this book and apply them.
4. The secret of getting things done is: DO IT NOW!
5. As long as you live, when the suggestion DO IT NOW! flashes
from your subconscious to your conscious mind to do that
which you ought to do, immediately follow through with
desirable action. It's a habit that will make you an outstanding
achiever.
6. The burden of learning is upon the person who Wants to learn.
If you want to learn how you can achieve anything in life that
doesn't violate the laws of God or the rights of your fellow
men, now is the time to begin to study and learn the concepts
that can teach you how to achieve your goals. Study and apply
the principles contained in Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude — don't only read what is written.
7. Now is the time to act.
DO IT NOW!

CHAPTER 9
How to Motivate Yourself
What is motivation?
Motivation is that which induces action or determines choice. It
is that which provides a motive. A motive is the "inner urge" only
within the individual which incites him to action, such as an
instinct, passion, emotion, habit, mood, impulse, desire or idea.
It is the hope or other force which starts an action in an attempt to
produce specific results.
Motivating yourself and others. When you know principles that
can motivate you, you will then know principles that can
motivate others. Conversely, when you know principles that can
motivate others, you will then know principles that can motivate
you.
How to motivate yourself is the purpose of this chapter. How to
motivate others is the purpose of Chapter Ten. How to motivate
yourself and others with a positive mental attitude is the purpose
of Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude. In essence, this is
a book on motivation.
Our purpose in illustrating specific experiences of the success and
failures of others is to motivate you to desirable action.
Now, therefore, to motivate yourself, try to understand principles
that motivate others — to motivate others, try to understand
principles that motivate you.
157
Establish the habit of motivating yourself with PMA... at will.
And then you can direct your thoughts, control your emotions and
ordain your destiny.
Motivate yourself and others with the magic ingredient. What
is the magic ingredient?
One man, in particular, found it. Here is his story.
Some years ago, this man, a successful cosmetic manufacturer,
retired at the age of sixty-five. Each year thereafter his friends
gave him a birthday party, and on each occasion they asked him
to disclose his formula. Year after year he pleasantly refused;
however, on his seventy-fifth birthday his friends, half jokingly
and half seriously, once again asked if he would disclose the
secret.
"You have been so wonderful to me over the years that I now will
tell you," he said. "You see, in addition to the formulas used by
other cosmeticians, I added the magic ingredient"
"What is the magic ingredient?" he was asked.
"I never promised a woman that my cosmetics would make her
beautiful, but I always gave her hope."
Hope is the magic ingredient!
Hope is a desire with the expectation of obtaining what is desired
and belief that it is obtainable. A person consciously reacts to that
which to him is desirable, believable, and attainable.
And he also subconsciously reacts to the inner urge that induces
action when environmental suggestion, self-suggestion, or
autosuggestion   cause   the   release   of   the   powers   of   his
158
subconscious mind. His response to suggestion may develop
obedience that is direct, neutral, or in reverse action to a specific
symbol. In other words, there may be various types and degrees
of motivating factors.
Every result has a given cause. Your every act is the result of a
given cause — your motives.
Hope, for example, motivated the cosmetic manufacturer to build
a profitable business. Hope also motivated women to buy his
cosmetics. Hope will motivate you, too.
The ten basic motives which inspire all human action. Every
thought you think, every act in which you voluntarily engage, can
be traced back to some definite motive or combination of
motives. There are ten basic motives which inspire all thoughts,
all voluntary actions. No one ever does anything without having
been motivated to do it.
When it comes to learning how to motivate yourself for any given
purpose, or how to motivate others, you should have a clear
understanding of these ten basic motives. Here they are:
1. The desire for SELF-PRESERVATION
2. The emotion of LOVE
3. The emotion of FEAR
4. The emotion of SEX
5. The desire for LIFE AFTER DEATH
6. The desire for FREEDOM OF BODY AND MIND
7. The emotion of ANGER
8. The emotion of HATE
9. The desire for RECOGNITION and SELF-EXPRESSION
10. The desire for MATERIAL GAIN
159
As you have been reading this chapter, perhaps you felt that it
contains food for thought. A good sandwich contains nine-tenths
bread and one-tenth meat. Unlike a sandwich, this chapter is nine-
tenths meat. That is the way the authors planned it. We hope you
will chew and digest it carefully.
Are negative emotions good? As you read Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude you clearly see that negative emotions,
feelings, and thoughts are harmful to the individual. But are there
times when these are good?
Yes, negative emotions, feelings, thoughts and attitudes are good
— at the proper time and under the right circumstances.
For that which is good for the species of man is good for the
individual. It is clear that in the process of evolution, negative
thoughts, feelings, emotions, and attitudes protected the
individual. In fact, these negatives prevented the species of man
from becoming extinct. And these negatives in a person, like the
negative forces of a bar magnet, effectively repelled the forces of
the negative powers others. This has been. And because it is a
universal law, it will continue to be.
Now culture, refinement, and civilization, like man himself, have
also evolved from a primitive state. And the more cultured,
refined, and civilized a society or environment may be, the less
need there is for the individual to use these negatives. But in a
negative, antagonistic environment, a person with common sense
will use these negative forces with PMA to oppose the evil with
which he is faced.
And because you live in a country with laws designed to bring
the greatest good to the greatest number; because the rights of tat
individual are protected, because you are in a society and
environment of culture, refinement, and the highest form of
160
civilization: those negative thoughts, feelings, emotions, and
passions which lie dormant within you from your hereditary past
are not now necessary to solve the problems which primitive man
could not otherwise have solved. For he was a law unto himself.
And the law of the individual has become subservient to the law
of society for his benefit.
Now let's clarify these concepts. Let's take anger, hate, and fear
as examples.
Anger and hate. Righteous indignation against evil is a form of
anger and hate. The desire to protect one's nation when attacked
by an enemy, or the desire to protect the weak against the
criminal attack of the madman to save human life is good. To kill
to accomplish this, when necessary, is an example of the worst
form of all negative feelings and emotions used to achieve a
worthy purpose. In our society the patriotism of a soldier or the
fulfillment of duty by a police officer are virtues.
Fear. With every new experience and in every new environment
nature protects you from potential danger by alerting you through
some shade of the emotion of fear. You can be assured that the
bravest individual will, in a new environment, at first, experience
an awareness that is a conscious or subconscious feeling of
timidity or fear. If he finds that the fears are not beneficial to him,
the person with PMA will neutralize an undesirable negative
emotion by substituting a positive one.
What can you do about it? Man is the only member of the
animal kingdom who, through the functioning of his conscious
mind, can voluntarily control his emotions from within, rather
than be forced to do so by external influences.
And he alone can deliberately change habits of emotional
response. The more civilized, cultured and refined you are, the
161
more easily you can control your emotions and feelings if you
choose to do so.
Emotions are controlled through the combination of reason and
action. When fears are unwarranted, or harmful, they can and
should be neutralized.
How?
While your emotions are not always immediately subject to
reason, nonetheless they are immediately subject to action. For
you can use reason to determine the needlessness of the negative
emotion and thus motivate yourself to action. You can substitute
fear with a positive feeling. How do you do this?
One effective means is through self-suggestion, in fact self-
command, with a one word symbol that incorporates what you
want to be. Thus, if you are afraid and want to be courageous,
give the self-command be courageous with rapidity several times.
Follow this with action. If you want to be courageous, act
courageously.
How?
Use the self-starter Do It Now! And then get into action.
In this and the next chapter you will see how to control your
emotions and actions by using self-suggestions. In the meantime:
Keep your mind on the things you should and do want and off the
things you shouldn't and don't want.
A success formula that always succeeds when applied. Are you
among the hundreds of thousands of persons throughout the
world who have read the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, or
162
among the tens of thousands who have read Frank Bettger's book
How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling? If not,
we recommend that you read both. These books contain a
formula that always succeeds when applied with PMA.
In his autobiography, Franklin indicates that he endeavored to
help Benjamin Franklin just as the most important living person
wants to help you. He wrote (language modernized):
"My intention being to acquire the habit of all these virtues, I
judged it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting
the whole at once, but to fix it on them at a time; and when I
should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on,
until I should gone through the thirteen, and, as the previous
acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain
others, I arranged them with that view... "
The names of these virtues as Franklin fitted than, together with
the precepts (self-motivators for self-suggestion) he gave each
one, are:
1. TEMPERANCE:
Eat   not   to   dullness;   drink   not   to
elevation.
2. SILENCE:
Speak not but what may benefit others
or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
3. ORDER:
Let all your things have their places; let
each part of your business have its
time.
4. RESOLUTION:
Resolve to perform what you ought;
perform without fail what you resolve.
163
5. FRUGALITY:
6. INDUSTRY:
7. SINCERITY:
8. JUSTICE:
9. MODERATION:
Make no expense but to do good to
others or yourself, that is, waste
nothing.
Lose no time; be always employed in
something useful; cut off all
unnecessary actions.
Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently
and justly, and, if you speak, speak
accordingly.
Wrong none by doing injuries, or
omitting the benefits that are your
duty.
Avoid extremes; forbear resenting
injuries so much as you think they
deserve.
10. CLEANLINESS:
11. TRANQUILITY:
Tolerate   no   uncleanliness   in   body,
clothes, or habitation.
Be   not   disturbed   at   trifles,   or   at
accidents, common or unavoidable.
12. CHASTITY:
13. HUMILITY:
Rarely use venery but for health or
offspring, never to dullness, weakness,
or the injury of your own or another's
peace or reputation.
Imitate Jesus and Socrates.
Franklin wrote further: "Conceiving then that, agreeably to the
advice of Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily examination
164
would be necessary, I contrived the following method for
conducting that examination.
"I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the
virtues. I ruled each page with red ink, so as to have seven
columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column
with a letter for the day. I crossed these columns with thirteen
red lines, making the beginning of each line with the first letter of
one of me virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I
might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon
examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon
that day." Here is the chart:

Now it is as important to know how to use a formula as it is to
know the formula. Here's how to use your Knowledge:
165
A FORMULA IN ACTION
1. Concentrate on one principle for an entire week, every day of
the week. Respond by proper action every time an occasion
arises.
2. And then, start the second week on the second principle of
virtue. Let the first be taken over by your subconscious mind.
Should an occasion arise when the employment of a previous
principle flashes into your conscious mind, use the self-starter
DO IT NOW! and then ACT! Continue to concentrate on one
principle at a time each week and leave the others to be
executed by the habits established in your subconscious as the
occasion arises.
3. When the series is completed, stat over again. Thus at the end
of a year, you will have completed the entire cycle four times.
4. When you have acquired a desired characteristic, substitute a
new principle for a new virtue, attitude, or activity that you
may wish to develop.
Now you have just read the method Benjamin Franklin used to
help Benjamin Franklin. As Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude is a self-help book, it would be wise for you to study
Franklin's method and see how you can apply the principles. In
the chapter entitled "How to Motivate Others" you will see how
Frank Bettger raised himself from failure to success by
employing Benjamin Franklin's plan.
If you decide to start your own plan, and don't know exactly what
principles to start with you could begin with the 13 virtues used
by Benjamin Franklin; or you may prefer the 17 success
principles described in Chapter Two.
166
Now for some bread for your sandwich. Let's tell about the first
Fuller Brush man.
Alfred C. Fuller, the first of the "Fuller Brush men," came from a
poor farm family living in Nova Scotia. Al couldn't seem to hold
a job. In fact, during the first two years of trying to earn a living,
he lost three jobs.
But then a radical change came into Fuller's life. For he tried
selling brushes. Right then Fuller was motivated. He began to
realize that his first three jobs were not the kind of work suited to
him.
He didn't like them.
The work didn't come to him naturally. But selling did. And he
saw immediately that he would do well as a salesman. He liked
his work. So Al conditioned his mind to do the best selling job in
the world. He was terrific.
And having succeeded as a salesman, he set a goal in his climb up
the ladder of success. It was: to go in business for himself. Now
this goal fitted nicely with his personality, provided he was in
sales.
Alfred C. Fuller did quit selling brushes for someone else. And he
bad more fun than ever before. He manufactured his own brushes
in the evening, then sold them the next day. And when his sales
began to mount, he rented space in an old shed for eleven dollars
a month and hired an assistant who made the brushes for him
while he concentrated on sales. The end result from the boy who
lost his first three jobs?
167
The Fuller Brush Company, with thousands of door-to-door
salesmen and millions of dollars in annual income! You see, you
are more apt to succeed if you do what comes naturally.
But there are greater motivating factors than losing a job, making
money, or success in business. The desire for self-preservation is
the strongest on the list.
Seven came through. Capt. Edward V. Rickenbacker was one of
the most successful and highly esteemed men in the United
States.
Capt Eddie, as he was affectionately called, is a symbol of faith,
integrity, the joy of hard work and common sense.
Those who met him, heard his lectures or read his book Seven
Came Through are themselves inspired by the symbol he
represents.
The airplane carrying Capt. Eddie and his crew fell into the
Pacific. No trace of the wreckage or the men could be found the
first week. Nor the second week. But the world was thrilled with
the news that Capt. Eddie was saved on the 21st day.
Just picture Capt. Eddie and his crew on three rafts in the Pacific
with nothing in sight but the sea and the sky. Picture these men
these men, if you will, suffering from the shock of hitting the
water when their plane crash landed, suffering from the heat of
the burning sun, hungry, thirsty. Then picture the three rafts tied
together each morning and evening, with each member of the
crew bowing his head in prayer or listening intently as the 23rd
Psalm or the verses from Matthew 6:31-34 were read: "Therefore
take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these
things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth
168
that ye have need of these things. But seek ye first the kingdom
of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added
unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the
morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof."
Now, you have the picture, so let's hear directly from Capt. Eddie
himself as he wrote in his book:
"As I have already stated, there was no time that I lost faith in our
ultimate rescue, but the others did not seem to share this state of
mind fully with me. My companions clearly began to think of
what lay beyond death and to think of it in terms of their own
lives.
"I say in all truth that at no time did I ever doubt we would be
saved.
"I tried to impart my own philosophy to these men hoping to
stimulate their desire to carry on. It was based upon the simple
observation that the longer I have had to suffer under trying
circumstances, the more certain I was to appreciate my
deliverance. This is part of the wisdom that comes to older men."
Should you ask us how to motivate yourself, we would list the
basic motives. They are repeated here!
First, the desire for self-preservation; then the emotion of: love,
fear, sex. The desire for: life after death; and freedom of body and
mind would follow. And after that, the emotion of: anger; and
hate. Then the desire for recognition and self-expression. And last
in the list of the ten basic motives would be the desire for
material wealth.
169
In the following chapter you will see how any one of these, or a
combination, motivates others.

Thoughts to Steer By
1. Motivation is that which induces action or determines choice.
It is the hope or other force which starts an action in an attempt
to produce specific results.
2. Motivate yourself with PMA. Remember: what the mind of
man can conceive and believe the mind of man can achieve
with PMA. Recognize the possibility of the improbable.
3. Hope is the magic ingredient in motivating yourself and others.
4. Negative emotions, feelings, thoughts, and attitudes are good at
the proper time and under the right circumstances.
5. The 10 basic motives are: self-preservation, love, fear, sex,
desire for life after death, freedom of body and mind, anger,
hate, desire for recognition and self-expression, and the desire
for material wealth.
6. Motivate yourself as Benjamin Franklin motivated himself.
Develop your own chart. DO IT NOW! If you have difficulty
listing 13 virtues you would like to acquire or goals you would
like to reach, you can start with one and then add to your list as
you realize what virtues or goals you desire. Like Benjamin
Franklin, have a self-motivator for each. Important: Inspect
your progress daily.

7. Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker had developed a strong faith that
came to his rescue in time of need. How can you strengthen
your faith to help you at the time of your greatest need?
8. Are you prepared so that you can and will apply your faith at
the time of your greatest need?

CHAPTER 10
How to Motivate Others
It is important to know how to motivate others in an effective
manner and in a desirable direction. Throughout life you play
dual parts in which you motivate others and they motivate you:
parent and child, teacher and pupil, salesman and buyer, master
and servant — you take each part.
How a child motivated his father. A boy two-and-one-half years
of age was walking with his father after a very heavy Christmas
Day dinner. When they had walked about a block and a half, the
youngster stopped, looked up at his father with a smile, and said:
"Daddy... " then hesitated. His father responded, "Yes?" The boy
paused for a second or two and continued, "If you say please, I'll
let you carry me," Now, who could resist this type of motivation?
Even a newborn baby motivates his parents to action.
And, of course, a parent motivates a child. We saw this illustrated
by Thomas Edison and his mother. Having confidence in a
youngster gives him confidence in himself. When the child feels
that he is wrapped in the warm, secure belief that he will do well;
he is actually able to do better than he knows. His defenses are
relaxed; his guard down: he is able to stop spending emotional
energy protecting himself from the possible hurts of failure;
instead he spends his energy reaching for the probable rewards of
success. He is relaxed. Confidence has had a measurable effect on
his ability — it has brought out the best in him. "My mother was
the making of me," said Edison. And Napoleon Hill himself had
an experience in this direction. He speaks about it in this way:
When I was a youngster, I was considered to be a hellion.
Whenever a cow was let loose from her pasture, or a dam
172
broken, or a tree cut down mysteriously, it was young
Napoleon Hill that everyone suspected.
And, furthermore, there was some justification for all of
this suspicion. My own mother was dead, and my father
and brothers thought I was bad, so I really was pretty
bad. If people considered me this way, I was not going to
disappoint them.
And then one day, my father announced that he was
going to remarry. All of us were worried about what kind
of a new "mother" we were going to have, but I in
particular was bound and determined that no new mother
coming into our home would be able to find a place in
my heart. The day finally came when this strange woman
entered our home. My father stood back and let her
handle the situation in her own way. She went around the
room and greeted each of us cheerfully — that is, until
she came to me. I stood straight as a ramrod, with my
hands folded over my chest, and glared at her without the
least suggestion of welcome in my eyes.
"And this is Napoleon," my father said. "The worst boy
in the hills."
And with that I'll never forget what my stepmother did.
She put both hands on my shoulders and looked me
straight in the eye with a twinkle in her own eyes that I
shall hold dear forever. "The worst boy?" she said. "Not
at all. He's just the brightest boy in these hills, and all we
have to do is bring that out in him."
My stepmother was always the one who encouraged me
to strike out on my own with such bold schemes as later
proved the backbone of my career. I will never forget the
173
great lesson she taught me in how to motivate others by
giving them confidence in themselves.
For my stepmother was the making of me. Her deep love
and unshakeable faith motivated me to try to become the
kind of a boy she believed me to be.
So you can motivate others by having faith in them. Faith, rightly
understood, is active, not passive. Passive faith is no more a force
than sight is in an eye that does not observe. Active faith steps
out on its belief and risks failure because it assumes it will
succeed.
When you motivate others by having faith in them, then you must
have an active faith. You must commit your belief. You must say,
"I know that you are going to succeed in this job, so I have
committed myself and others to your success. We are here,
waiting for you... "
When you have that kind of faith in another man, he will succeed.
Now faith can be expressed in a letter. In fact, a letter is an
excellent tool for expressing one's thoughts and motivating
another person.
A letter can change a life for the better. Anyone who writes a
letter affects the subconscious mind of the receiver through
suggestion. And the power of this suggestion is, of course,
dependent upon several factors.
If you are a parent, for example, and your son or daughter is away
at school, you can accomplish that which you might not
otherwise achieve. You can grasp the opportunity: (a) to mold the
character of your child; (b) to discuss matters that you might
174
hesitate or never take the time to discuss in conversation; and (c)
to express your inner thoughts.
Now a boy or girl may not readily accept advice when it is given
verbally. For environment and emotions involved at the time of
the conversation might prevent this. And yet the same boy or girl
would treasure the same advice received in a carefully written,
sincere letter.
To a son or daughter away from home a letter with all of its
contents, including advice, is most welcome. And if it is properly
written, it may be read frequently, studied, and digested.
And the executive or sales manager who writes the right type of
letter to his salesmen can motivate them to break all previous
records. Likewise the salesman who writes his sales manager will
benefit from this tool of motivation.
Now to write a letter, one must think. Therefore, the writer should
crystallize his ideas on paper. And he can ask questions to direct
the recipient's mind in the desired channels. In fact he can ask a
question to obtain a letter in return. Or when the person he would
like to hear from does not write, he, like an advertising expert,
can use a bait. That's what J. Pierpont Morgan did.
One way to motivate a college student to write. J. Pierpont
Morgan proved there is at least one way to get college students to
answer a letter. His sister had complained that her two college
sons just wouldn't write home. Mr. Morgan said that he could get
the boys to respond immediately if he sent a letter. And then his
sister challenged him to prove it. So he wrote each nephew and
received an immediate reply from both.
Surprised, his sister asked, "How did you do it?"
175
Morgan handed the letters to her and she saw that both contained
interesting information about college life and thoughts of home.
But the postscript on each was similar. One read: "The ten dollars
you said was enclosed in your letter wasn't received!"
Motivate by example. A successful sales manager knows that
one of the most effective means to motivate a salesman is to set
an example when working with him in the field. W. Clement
Stone has inspired many people with the story he tells about how
he trained a salesman who Jived at Sioux City, Iowa. Here's the
way he tells it:
I listened to one of our salesmen at Sioux City, Iowa,
gripe for over two hours one evening. Now he kept on
telling how he had worked for two days at Sioux Center
without making a sale. He said: "It's impossible to sell at
Sioux Center because the people there are Holland
Dutch, they're clannish and they won't buy from a
stranger. Besides, the territory has had a crop failure for
five years."
I suggested that we sell the next day at Sioux Center, the
town where he had worked for two days without making
a sale. So the next morning we drove to Sioux Center. For
there I intended to prove that the salesman with PMA
who believed in and used our company's system could sell
regardless of the obstacles.
And while the salesman was driving, I closed my eyes,
relaxed, meditated, and conditioned my mind. I kept my
mind on the reasons why I should and would sell these
people rather than why I wouldn't or couldn't.
Here's what I thought: He says that they are Holland
Dutch  and  clannish;  therefore  they won't  buy.  That's
176
good! What's so good about it? It's a well known fact that
if you sell one of a clan, particularly a leader, you can sell
the entire clan. Now all I have to do is to make the first
sale to the right person. I'll do it even if it takes a long
time.
Again, he claims that the territory has had a crop failure
for five years. What could be more wonderful? The
Holland Dutch are marvelous people and they save their
money. Also they are responsible and want to protect
their families and property. And, as a matter of fact, they
probably have not purchased accident insurance from any
other insurance salesman because other salesmen
wouldn't even try. For they, like the salesman with whom
I am driving, would have a negative mental attitude. Our
policies offer excellent protection at a low cost. Actually
I'll find no competition!
I then engaged in what I term "mind-conditioning." I
repeated to myself with reverence, sincerity, expectation,
and emotion, "Please God help me sell! Please God help
me sell! Please God help me sell!" Over and over again I
repeated, "Please God help me sell!" Then I took a nap.
And when we arrived at Sioux Center, we called at the
bank. Now the personnel consisted of a vice president, a
cashier and a teller. Within twenty minutes the vice
president had purchased the most protection our
company was willing to sell, a full unit. And the cashier
purchased a full unit. But the teller will never be forgotten
by me because he didn't buy.
And starting with the first place of business next to the
bank, we began cold canvassing systematically, store after
store, office after office; we interviewed every individual
in each establishment.
177
An amazing thing happened: every person we called on
that day purchased the full unit. And there was no
exception.
While riding back to Sioux City I thanked the Divine
Power for the assistance I had received.
Now why did I succeed in selling in the same place where
the other man had failed? Actually I experienced success
for exactly the same reasons that he had experienced
failure, except for the — something more.
He said it was impossible to sell them because they were
Holland Dutch and clannish. That's NMA. Now I knew
they would buy because they were Holland Dutch and
clannish. That's PMA.
Again, he said it was impossible to sell them because they
had had a crop failure for five years. That's NMA.
I knew they would buy because they had had a crop
failure for five years. And that's PMA.
Now the something more was the difference between PMA
and NMA. For I had asked for Divine Guidance and
help. What's more, I believed that I was receiving it.
Now this salesman returned to Sioux Center and stayed
for a long tune. And each day that he was there was a
record day in sales for him.
This illustrates the value of motivating another person by
example, for this salesman also succeeded where he had
failed because he learned the value of working with a
positive mental attitude.
178
There are many ways to motivate a person, but a most effective
way is through an inspirational book.
When you want to motivate, say it with an inspirational, self-
help action book. The most important factors to success in
selling are, in order of importance: (a) inspiration to action; (b)
knowledge of a successful sales technique for the particular
product or service — which is termed know-how; and (c)
knowledge of the product or service itself, activity knowledge.
Now, these same three principles can be related to success in any
business or profession.
In the story that you have just read you can assume that the
salesman had knowledge of the sales know-how and knowledge
of the service he was selling. But he did lack the most important
ingredient — inspiration to action.
Many years ago, Morris Pickus, a well-known sales executive
and sales counselor, gave W. Clement Stone a copy of Think and
Grow Rich. Since then, he has used inspirational books such as
those mentioned in Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude to
help salesmen develop inspiration to action. Mr. Stone knows that
inspiration and enthusiasm are the life of a sales organization.
And because the flame of inspiration and enthusiasm will be
extinguished unless the fuel that feeds it is kept replenished, Mr.
Stone has made it a habit to see that his representatives receive
inspirational, self-help action books frequently. And this is in
addition to weekly and monthly publications that are intended to
act as mental vitamins.
If yon know what motivates a person, yon can motivate him.
As a boy Walter Clarke of Walter Clarke Associates, Providence,
Rhode Island, intended to be a doctor. But when he grew older,
he thought he wanted to become an engineer. And he studied
engineering.
179
At Columbia University, however, he found the study of the
functioning of the human mind so interesting and challenging that
he changed from engineering to psychology. And finally he
received his Master's Degree.
Walter Clarke worked as a personnel officer in Macy's
Department Store and several other well-known concerns. At that
tune the known psychological tests developed the specific
information for which they were intended: an applicant's I.Q.,
aptitude, and personality. But something important was missing!
Walter endeavored to find the missing factor. He thought: "An
engineer can select the proper part and put it in its place so that a
machine will function efficiently. And that is exactly what I want
to do with people. I want to select the right person for the right
job."
You see, Walter, like many personnel officers, found: people fail
on their job even though their psychological tests indicated that
they had sufficient intelligence, aptitude and personality to
succeed on the job. "Why then do we have so much absenteeism,
turn-over, and failure?" he asked himself. "What's the missing
factor?"
Now the answer to this question became so simple and obvious
that it is truly amazing that other psychologists had not
discovered it. For you see a person is more than a mechanical
body. He is a mind with a body. He succeeds or fails because he
is — or is not — motivated.
Therefore, Walter endeavored to develop an analysis technique
that would:
(a) Indicate the individual's tendencies in behavior in   either
a pleasant or antagonistic environment;
180
(b) Show the sort of environment that attracts and repels
him under favorable or unfavorable situations;
(c) In essence — indicate "what comes naturally" to the
individual.
Also, he endeavored to develop a technique that could be used to
analyze the requirements of a given job successfully.
And because he worked hard and continued to search, Walter
Clarke found and recognized exactly what he was looking for.
For he developed what he called Activity Vector Analysis, better
known as AVA. It is based on semantics, specifically: the
reaction of the individual to word symbols. From the answers
given, by the applicant, Clarke designed a chart. And he likewise
came up with a formula for designing a similar diagram for any
specific job.
Now when the diagram of the applicant corresponded with that of
the job, he had a perfect combination.
Why?
For then the applicant would have a job doing the kind of work
that came naturally to him. And a person will do what he likes to
do — it's fun.
Now the sole purpose of AVA as conceived by Walter Clarke is
to help business management in: (a) the selection of personnel;
(b) management development; (c) cutting the high cost of
absenteeism; (d) personnel turnover.
Walter Clarke achieved a definite major aim. Now for many
years W. Clement Stone kept searching for a scientific working
tool that could aid him in his efforts to help the representatives
181
under his supervision to achieve success in solving their personal,
family, social, and business problems. He was looking for a
simple, accurate and usable formula that would eliminate
guesswork and save time when applied to a specific individual in
a given environment.
Therefore when he heard of AVA, Mr. Stone investigated and
immediately recognized that it was the working tool that he had
so long been looking for. He could see that AVA might be used
for purposes far beyond that for which it was conceived. And
when he studied under Walter Clarke, his conclusions were
confirmed.
For when you know: (a) what the personality traits of the
individual are; (b) what his environment is; (c) what motivates
him, you then can motivate that individual.
How to motivate another person. While reading Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude, you have seen the
importance of: semantics, word symbols, suggestion, self-
suggestion, and autosuggestion. This was particularly true when
you read Chapter Four. Now Mr. Stone combined this knowledge
with what he learned from AVA.
And thus he made what to him was a great discovery in the
technique of motivating other persons.
For the discovery was: with PMA you can be what you want to
be, if you are willing to pay the price. This is true regardless of
your past experiences, aptitude, I.Q. or environment. Remember
— you have the power to choose.
Now you don't have to study AVA to learn how to motivate
yourself and others. But it could certainly help you. For you can
182
use the proper technique when you know what motivates an
individual.
And the simple technique that you can use to help you motivate
yourself and others is based on the use of suggestion, self-
suggestion, and autosuggestion. Let's be specific:
1. If for example a salesman is timid and his job requires him to
be aggressive, then:
(a) The sales manager uses reason to point out that timidity and
fear are natural. He proves that others have overcome
timidity. He then recommends that the salesman state to
himself frequently a word or self-motivator that would
symbolize what the salesman wants to be.
(b) And in this instance, the salesman would repeat every
morning and other times throughout the day the following
words with rapidity and frequency: "Be aggressive! Be
aggressive!" He would particularly do so if he had a feeling of
timidity in a specific environment where it was necessary to
act. In such an instance he would act on the self-starter: Do It
Now!
2. When a sales manager discovers that one of his men is deceitful
or dishonest, he will have a talk with his representative. And if he
sees the representative wants to cure the fault, then:
(a) The sales manager tells how others have solved this
difficulty. He gives the salesman an inspirational book,
article, poem or recommends specific Bible passages. We
have found that books like I Can by Ben Sweetland and I
Dare You by William Danforth are particularly effective.
183
(b) And in such an instance, as in (b) above, the salesman
would repeat "Be truthful! Be truthful!" with rapidity every
morning and at frequent intervals throughout the day. He
would particularly do so at the time that he was tempted to
be dishonest or engage in deception in a specific
environment where it was necessary for him to make a
decision. He would act on the self-motivator: "Have the
courage to face the truth" as well as the self-starter: Do It
Now!
Now this plan should be easy for you to understand as it is
illustrated frequently throughout this book.
And because you understand its effectiveness, you yourself will
use it.
And in addition, you, unlike the hundreds of thousands of persons
who have read Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, will now
immediately use Franklin's method to achieve success. You,
unlike them, have been given The Secret of Getting Things Done:
DO IT NOW!
Use Franklin's method to achieve results! Yes, many hundreds
of thousands of persons have read Benjamin Franklin's
Autobiography. Yet they didn't learn how to use the success
principles contained in it. But at least one man did: Frank Bettger.
He listened to the messages that were applicable to him. For he
had a problem: he was a failure in business. And he was
searching for a workable, down-to-earth formula that would help
him help himself. And because he knew what he was looking for,
he discovered Franklin's secret.
Franklin indicated that he owed all of his success and happiness
to just one idea: a formula for personal achievement Now Bettger
184
recognized that formula and used it What happened? He raised
himself from failure to success. He tells us about it in his great,
motivating book, How I Raised My self from Failure to Success in
Selling.
Now, why shouldn't you use Franklin's formula for personal
achievement? You can, if you will. If the authors of this book
succeed in motivating you to use this one idea, you too will, like
Bettger, be able to raise yourself from failure to success. Or, if
you are not a failure, then you will — through the use of
Franklin's method — be able to obtain what you seek: be it
wisdom, virtue, happiness, health, or wealth.
Now Bettger wrote out his objectives on thirteen separate cards.
The first one is entitled "Enthusiasm." The self-motivator is: To
be enthusiastic ACT enthusiastic. As the great teacher and
psychologist, William James, has so conclusively proved: the
emotions are not immediately subject to reason, but they are
always immediately subject to action.
And the action can be physical or it can be mental. A thought can
be just as stimulating and effective as a deed in changing an
emotion from negative to positive. In such an instance the act, be
it physical or mental, precedes the emotion.
See how the plan works. Because the purpose of Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude is to help you help yourself,
and because the authors want you to get into action, we shall now
illustrate how we motivate individuals in an audience to action
through the Franklin-Bettger System.
Here's how we have motivated many thousands of students to
apply the Franklin-Bettger plan using the card "Enthusiasm" and
the self-motivator: To be enthusiastic act enthusiastic. We call a
student to the front of the lass and give him a simple yet effective
185
lesson that he will learn immediately. Here's how we do it — try
it. Here is the dialogue that would take place between the in-
structor and student:
(Note: The dialogue of the instructor is in bold-face type. The
student's answers are set in italics.)
Do you want to feel enthusiastic?
Yes.
Then learn the self-motivator: To be enthusiastic act
enthusiastic. Now repeat this phrase.
To be enthusiastic act enthusiastic.
Right! What is the key word in the affirmation?
Act.
That's right Let's paraphrase the message and thus you will
learn the principle and be able to relate and assimilate it into
your own life. If you want to be sick, what do you do?
Act sick
You're right. If you want to be melancholy, what do you do?
Act melancholy.
Right again! And if you want to be enthusiastic, what do you
do?
To be enthusiastic — act enthusiastic.
186
We then proceed to point out that you can relate this self-
motivator to any desirable virtue or personal aim. Thus we might
take justice as an example, and a card could read: To be just,
ACT just.
And then the instructor would proceed:
Remember, when someone else's idea is accepted by you, it
becomes your idea for your use. You own it! Now I want you to talk
in an enthusiastic tone of voice. I want you to act enthusiastically.
To speak enthusiastically, do the following:
1. Talk loudly! This is particularly necessary if you are emotionally
upset, if you are shaking inside when you stand before an
audience, if you have "butterflies in your stomach."
2. Talk rapidly! Your mind functions more quickly when you do.
You can read two books with greater understanding in the time
you now read one if you concentrate and read with rapidity.
3. Emphasise! Emphasize important words, words that are important
to you or your listening audience — a word \ikeyou, for example.
4. Hesitate! When you talk rapidly, hesitate where there would be a
period, comma, or other punctuation in the written word.
Thus you employ the dramatic effect of silence. The mind of the
person who is listening catches up with the thoughts you have
expressed. Hesitation after a word which you wish to emphasize
accentuates the emphasis.
5. Keep a smile in your voice! Thus in talking loudly and rapidly, you
eliminate gruffness. You can put a smile in your voice by putting
a smile on your face, a smile in your eyes.
187
6. Modulate! This is important if you are speaking for a long period.
Remember, you can modulate both pitch and volume. You can
speak loudly and intermittently change to a conversational tone
and a lower pitch if you wish.
7. When the butterflies stop flying around in your stomach, you can
then speak in an enthusiastic, conversational tone of voice.
Do it now! Now in the previous chapter you have read the
thirteen principles used by Benjamin Franklin. And here you
have been told that enthusiasm is the first of the thirteen
principles used by Frank Bettger. And you know that a Positive
Mental Attitude is the first of the 17 Success Principles.
Therefore, if you have not already done so, start the first of your
own 17 cards with the heading "Develop a Positive Mental
Attitude." Follow through with a card for each of the 17 Success
Principles and — use Franklin's method to achieve results.
Your action on the self-starter DO IT NOW at this time would
prove conclusively that you can motivate yourself. You can! And
if you purposely motivate yourself, you will find it easy to
motivate others.
And now that you know how to motivate yourself; and others,
you are ready to receive the Key to the Citadel of Wealth. The
next chapter answers the question: Is There a Short Cut to
Riches?

Thoughts to Steer By
1. Throughout life you play dual parts in which you motivate
others and they motivate you. Learn and apply the art of
motivation with PMA.
188
2. Motivate others to have confidence in themselves by showing
them that you have faith in them and faith in yourself.
3. A letter can change a life for the better. Start the habit of
motivating your loved ones by writing letters containing
wholesome, good suggestions.
4. Motivate others by example.
5. When you want to motivate, say it with an inspirational, self-
help action book.
6. If you know what motivates a person — you can motivate him
if you learn the art of motivation with PMA.
7. Motivate others by suggestion. Motivate yourself by self-
suggestion.
8. While your emotions are not always subject to reason,
nonetheless they are subject to action. If there is an instance
you recall in which you might experience the emotion of fear,
what action do you think you could take to neutralize it?
9. To become enthusiastic, act enthusiastically!
10. To speak enthusiastically and overcome timidity and fear: (a)
talk loudly; (b) talk rapidly; (c) emphasize important words;
(d) hesitate where there is a period, comma or other
punctuation in the written word; (e) keep a smile in your voice
so that it isn't gruff; and (f) use modulation.

CHAPTER 11
Is There a Short Cut to Riches?
Is there a short cut to riches?
A short cut is defined as: a way of accomplishing something
more directly and quickly than by ordinary procedure. It is a route
more direct than that ordinarily taken.
And the man who takes the short cut knows his destination. He
knows the route that is more direct. Yet he will never arrive at his
destination unless he starts and continues toward it regardless of
the interruptions he encounters or the obstacles he meets.
In Chapter Two we listed the 17 success principles as:
1. A Positive Mental Attitude
2. Definiteness of purpose
3. Going the extra mile
4. Accurate thinking
5. Self-discipline
6. The mastermind
7. Applied faith
8. A pleasing personality
9. Personal initiative
10. Enthusiasm
11. Controlled attention
12. Teamwork
13. Learning from defeat
14. Creative vision
15. Budgeting time and money
16. Maintaining sound physical and mental health
17. Using cosmic habit force
191
Now why do we repeat the 17 success principles?
We want to show you the short cut to riches. We want you to take
the most direct route.
Now to take the most direct route, you must necessarily think
with PMA... and a positive mental attitude results from the
application of these success principles.
The word think is a symbol. Its meaning for you depends upon
who you are.
Who are you?
You are the product of your: heredity, environment, physical
body, conscious and subconscious mind, experience, and
particular position and direction in time and space, and something
more, including powers known and unknown.
When you think with PMA — you can affect, use, control, or
harmonize with all of them.
Now only you can think for you.
Therefore, the short cut to riches for you can be expressed in a
six-word symbol:
Think with PMA and Grow Rich!
For if you really think with PMA, you will automatically follow
through with action. You will employ the PMA principles
expressed in this book — principles that will help you achieve
any goal that doesn't violate the laws of God or the rights of your
fellow men.

CHAPTER 12
Attract — Don't Repel — Wealth
Whoever you are — regardless of your age, your education, or
your occupation — you can attract wealth. You can also repel it.
We say: "Attract — don't repel — wealth."
This chapter tells you how you can make money. Would you like
to be rich? Be truthful with yourself. Of course you would. Or —
are you afraid to be rich?
Perhaps you're sick and because of this, you don't try to acquire
wealth. If this be the case, just remember the experience of Milo
C. Jones about whom you read in Chapter Two.
Or, if you are a, patient in a hospital, you can attract wealth by
engaging in study, thinking, and planning time as George Stefek
did.
In a hospital bed — think! Time after time as we have studied
the careers of successful men, we have discovered that they date
their own success from the day they picked up a self-
improvement book. Never underestimate the value of a book.
Books are tools, providing inspiration which can launch you onto
a bold new program and which can also light the dark days that
any such program entails.
George Stefek was convalescing at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Hines, Illinois. There he discovered by accident the
value of thinking time. Financially — he was broke. While
George was convalescing, he had a great deal of time on his
hands. There wasn't too much to do except read and think. He
read Think and Grow Rich. And he was ready.
194
An idea occurred to him. Many laundries, George knew, fold
their newly ironed shirts over a piece of cardboard to keep the
shirts stiff and free from wrinkles. By writing a few letters,
George learned that these shirt boards cost the laundries about
$4.00 per thousand. His idea was to sell the boards for $1.00 a
thousand; however, each one would carry an advertisement. The
advertisers would, of course, pay for the space, and George
would make a profit.
George had an idea and he tried to make it work.
When he left the hospital, he got into action!
New in the advertising field, he had his problems. But he finally
developed successful sales techniques through what others term
"trial and error" and we term "trial and success."
George continued the custom he had started in the hospital to
engage in study, thinking and planning time each day.
Even when George's business was moving ahead swiftly, he
decided to increase his sales by increasing the efficiency of his
service. The shirt boards, when withdrawn from the shirts, were
not retained by the laundries' customers.
Now, he asked himself the question: "How can I get families to
keep these shirt boards with the advertisements on them?" The
solution flashed into his mind.
What did he do? On one side of the shirt board he continued to
print an advertisement in black and white or in colors. On the
other side he added something new — an interesting game for the
children, a delicious recipe for the wife, or a provocative
crossword puzzle for the whole family. George tells about one
husband who complained that his laundry bill had gone up in a
sudden, unaccountable way. Then he discovered that his wife was
195
sending in shirts to the laundry which ordinarily he could have
worn another day, just to get more of George's recipes!
But George didn't stop there. He was ambitious. He wanted to
expand his business still further. Again he asked himself the
question: "How?" And he found the answer.
George Stefek gave the entire $1.00 per thousand he received
from the laundries to the American Institute of Laundering. The
Institute, in turn, recommended that each member help himself
and his trade association by using George Stefek's shirt boards
exclusively.
And thus George made another important discovery: the more
you give of that which is good and desirable — the more you get!
Now a carefully planned thinking time session brought George
Stefek considerable wealth. He discovered that a time apart is
essential to any successful attraction of riches.
It is in quiet that our best ideas occur to us. Don't make the
mistake of believing that by a frantic kind of dashing around you
are being your most effective and efficient self. Don't assume that
you are wasting tune when you take time out for thought.
Thought is the foundation upon which all else is built by man.
Now it isn't necessary for you to go to a hospital to establish the
habit of reading good motivating books, to think or to make
plans. And your thinking, study, and planning sessions need not
be too lengthy. If you invest only one per cent of your time in a
study, thinking, and planning session it will make an amazing
difference in the speed with which you reach your goals.
Your day has 1,440 minutes in it. Invest one per cent of that time
in a study, thinking and planning session. And you will be
196
astounded at what those fourteen minutes do for you. For it may
surprise you to find that when you develop this habit you will
receive constructive ideas almost any time or anywhere you
might be: while doing the dishes, or riding the bus, or while
taking a bath.
Be certain to use two of the greatest, yet simplest working tools
ever invented — tools used by a genius like Thomas Edison — a
pencil and a piece of paper. For he always had handy — paper
and pencil. And thus you, like him, will record the ideas that
come to you day or night.
Another requirement to attract wealth is to learn how to set your
goal. It is important for you to understand this. Few people, even
when they realize its importance, really understand how to set a
goal.
Learn how to set your goals. There are four important things to
keep in mind.
(a) Write down your goal. You will then begin to crystallize your
thinking. The very act of thinking as you write will have a
tendency to create an indelible impression in your memory.
(b) Give yourself a deadline. Specify a time for achieving your objective.
This is important in motivating you: set out in the direction of
your goal and keep moving towards it.
(c) Set your standards high. Now there seems to be a direct relationship
between ease in achieving a goal and the strength of your
motives. You have discovered for yourself in Chapter Nine how
to motivate yourself at will and in Chapter Ten how to motivate
others.
And   the   higher   you   set   your   major   goal,   generally
speaking, the more concentrated will be the effort you
197
make to achieve it. The reason: logic will make it
mandatory that you at least aim at an intermediate
objective as well as an immediate one. So aim higher. And
then have immediate and intermediate steps leading
towards its achievement.
The following question should stimulate your thinking:
Where will you be and what will you be doing ten years
from today if you keep doing what you are doing now?
(d) Aim high. It is a peculiar thing that no more effort is required to
aim high in life, to demand prosperity and abundance, than is
required to accept misery and poverty.
I bargained with life for a penny,
And life would pay no more,
However, I begged at evening when I counted
my scanty store.
For life is a just employer, it gives you what
you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why, you must bear the task.
I worked for a menial's hire, only to learn,
dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of life,
Life would have willingly paid.
You have to be bold enough to ask of life more than you
may, right now, feel you are worth because it is an
observable fact that people tend to rise to meet demands
that are put upon them.
While it is exceedingly desirable that you blueprint your
program   from   beginning   to   end,   this   is   not   always
198
feasible. One doesn't always know all the answers
between the beginning of a great enterprise or journey
and its ending. But if you know where you are and where
you want to be and you start from where you are to get to
where you want to be, you will, if you keep properly
motivated, move forward step by step until you get there.
Take that first step. The important thing after setting a goal is
taking action. A sixty-three-year-old grandmother, Mrs. Charles
Philipia, decided that she was going to walk from New York City
to Miami, Florida. She reached Miami and, while there, was
interviewed by newspapermen. They wanted to know if the idea
of such a long journey on foot hadn't frightened her. How did she
ever summon courage to make such a journey with her feet as her
only mode of travel?
"It doesn't take courage to take one step," replied Mrs. Philipia.
"And that's all I did really. I just took one step. And then I took
another step. And then another and another and here I am."
Yes, you must take that first step. It makes no difference how
much thinking and study time you spend, it will avail you little
unless you also act.
One of the authors was introduced to a man in Phoenix, Arizona,
by a friend. It was a rather odd introduction.
"Meet the man who received a million dollars cash for a gold
mine and now has the million dollars and also owns the mine."
"How in the world did you manage such a thing?" came the
question, asked with considerable awe.
199
"Oh, I had an idea, but I didn't have any money. I did have a pick
and a shovel. So I took my pick and my shovel and went out to
make my idea a reality," he responded.
"And then it occurred to me: if I would search for a gold mine
and dig around the vein, should I find a mine, one of the large
mining corporations could afford to work the mine whereas I
wouldn't have the necessary capital You know, mining machinery
costs money today.
"So I searched for and found a vein of gold. Every indication was
that I had made a very rich strike. I sold it for two million dollars.
The terms were a million dollars in cash and a first mortgage of a
million dollars. While mining operations were underway the vein
ran out I informed the owners of the mining company that if they
wanted to abandon the mine, I would take it back and cancel their
mortgage. They accepted. So you see, I got a million dollars cash
for the mine and still have the million dollars and the mine."
Wealth repelled with NMA. A positive mental attitude will
attract wealth but a negative mental attitude will do just the
opposite.
With a positive mental attitude you will keep trying until you
achieve the wealth you are seeking. Now you might start with a
positive mental attitude and make your first step forward. Yet you
may become influenced by the negative side of your talisman and
stop when you are just one step from reaching your destination.
You may fail to employ one of the 17 success principles. Here's a
very good example:
Let's call our man Oscar. In the latter part of 1929, he was at the
railroad station in Oklahoma City where it was necessary for him
to wait several hours for a train connection east. He had spent
months in the western deserts in temperatures as high as 110
200
degrees. He was seeking oil for an eastern concern. And he was
successful.
Oscar was a graduate of M.I.T. It is said that he had combined the
old divining rod, galvanometer, magnetometer, oscillograph,
radio tubes, and other instruments, into a Doodle Bug for
detecting oil deposits.
Now Oscar had received word that the company he represented
was insolvent. It had become bankrupt because the president had
used the firm's large cash resources in speculation in the stock
market. The market crashed in late 1929. Oscar was on his way
home. He was out of a job, and the outlook was rather dismal.
The influence of NMA began to exert a powerful influence on
him.
Because he had to wait several hours, he decided to occupy
himself by setting up his instrument in the railroad station. The
reading on his instrument was so high in its positive indication of
oil deposits that Oscar in a rage impulsively kicked the
instrument and destroyed it.
You see, Oscar was frustrated.
"There couldn't be that much oil! There couldn't be that much
oil!" he shouted repeatedly in disgust.
But Oscar was frustrated. He was under the influence of a
negative mental attitude. The opportunity for which he had been
searching lay at his very feet. He only had to make one step to
reach it. But, because of the influence of NMA, he refused to
recognize it
He lost faith in his own invention. Had he been under the
influence of PMA, he would have attracted wealth, not repelled it
201
Applied faith is one of the important 17 success principles. The
test of your faith is whether you apply it at the time of your
greatest need.
NMA had led Oscar to believe that many of the things that he had
faith in were wrong. As you recall: the Depression brought a fear
consciousness into the minds of many persons — Oscar was one.
He had worked hard and sacrificed, yet he was out of a job
through no fault of his own. The president of his company had
been held in high esteem by Oscar, yet this man whom he trusted
embezzled the company's funds. Now the machine that had
proved its value in the past seemed to have gone haywire. Yes —
Oscar was frustrated.
When Oscar boarded the train at the Oklahoma City railroad
station that day, he left his Doodle Bug behind. And he also left
one of the nation's richest oil deposits.
A short time later, Oklahoma City was found to be literally
floating on oil. Oscar has become a living demonstration of the
application of two principles:
A positive mental attitude attracts wealth and a negative mental
attitude repels it.
Wealth can be acquired on a modest salary. But you may say:
"All this about positive and negative mental attitudes is very fine
for someone who's out to make a million dollars. But I'm not
really interested in making a million.
"Of course, I want security. I want enough to live well and take
care of the needs I will have some day when I retire.
"What about me if I am an office employee? What about me
when I have just a fair salary?" Now here's our answer:
202
You too can acquire wealth. Wealth enough for security. Or, even
wealth enough to become rich in spite of what you say. Just let
the PMA influence of your talisman affect you favorably.
We'll prove that this can be done.
And if for some reason you aren't fully convinced, just read a
book: The Richest Man in Babylon. And then make your first step
forward. Keep going and you'll have the financial security or
wealth you are seeking. Now that's exactly what Mr. Osborn did.
Mr. Osborn was a salaried employee, yet he acquired wealth. It
wasn't so many years ago that he retired with the statement: "I
now spend my time having my money make money for me while
I do what I want to do."
Again, the principle used by Mr. Osborn is so obvious that it is
often unseen.
The principle he learned and the one that you also can employ
will now be stated in a very few words. In reading The Richest
Man in Babylon, Mr. Osborn found that wealth could be acquired
if you:
(a) Just save one dime out of every dollar you earn;
(b) Each six months, invest your savings and interest or dividend
returns from these savings and investments; and
(c) When you invest, seek expert advice on safe investments and
thus you won't gamble and lose your principal.
Let us repeat: that's exactly what Mr. Osborn did. Just think of it.
You can have security or wealth by saving only a dime out of
each dollar you earn and investing it safely.
203
When should you start? Do It Now!
Now let's contrast Mr. Osborn's experience with that of a man
who had good physical health and read an inspirational book. He
was fifty years old when he was introduced to Napoleon Hill.
This man smiled when he said, "I read your book Think and
Grow Rich many years ago — but I'm not rich."
Napoleon Hill laughed and then replied seriously:
"But you can be rich. Your future is ahead of you. You must
prepare yourself to be ready. And in making yourself ready for
the opportunities that are available to you, you must first develop
a positive mental attitude." And the interesting thing is that this
man did heed the author's advice. Five years later, the man wasn't
rich, but he had developed a positive mental attitude. And he was
on his way to wealth. He had been many thousands of dollars in
debt. Within the five-year period, he had gotten completely out of
debt and had begun making investments with the money he had
saved.
He developed PMA as he studied the book Think and Grow Rich.
He did not only read it. He had learned to recognize principles
and apply them.
When the NMA side of his talisman was influencing him, he was
like those workmen who blame their tools for poor
craftsmanship.
Have you ever blamed your tools?
Where does the fault lie: If you own a perfect camera and use the
right film; if you have the proper set of rules to take perfect
pictures under all types of circumstances; if someone else takes
perfect photographs with your camera but — yours are failures?
204
Does the fault lie with the camera?
Could it be that you have read the rules but haven't taken the time
to understand them? Or, if you do understand them, that you don't
apply the rules?
Could it be that you will read Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude — a book that could change the entire course of your life
for the better—without taking the time to understand, memorize
self-motivators, learn the principles that will guarantee success —
and apply them? Your answer will be evident to you by your
action.
Now, it's not too late to learn.
If you haven't learned by now, you might as well learn now: you
will not succeed consistently unless you know and understand the
rules; you will not continuously succeed unless you apply the
rules. Therefore, take the time to understand and apply what you
are reading in this book. PMA will help you.
"The home of my dreams." Remember, the thoughts that you
think and the statements you make regarding yourself determine
your mental attitude. If you have a worthwhile objective, find the
one reason why you can achieve it rather than hundreds of
reasons why you can't.
One of the rules in obtaining what you want through PMA is to
act once you have your sights on a goal. Another is: "Go the extra
mile." W. Clement Stone tells of the following experience which
illustrates both rules.
One April evening, while I was visiting Frank and Claudia
Noonan in Mexico City, Claudia commented, "I wish we
could have a home in the Jardines del Pedregal de San Angel."
("This is the most desirable section of that beautiful city.)
205
"Why don't you?" I asked
Frank laughed and answered, "We don't have the money."
"Does that make any difference, if you know what you want?"
I inquired, and then, without waiting for a response, I asked a
question that I might ask of you.
"By the way, have you ever read an inspirational, motivating
book like Think and Grow Rich, The Power of Positive Thinking, I
Can, I Dare You, TNT, Applied Imagination, Turn on the Green
Tights in YourTife, Acres of Diamonds, or The Magic of Believing?"
"No," was the response.
Thereupon I told of several experiences of those persons
who: knew what they wanted; read an inspirational book;
listened to its message; and then got into action.
And I even told how years ago I purchased a new $30,000
home on my own terms — with a $1500 down payment and
how in due course it was completely paid for. I promised to
send one of the recommended books. I did.
Frank and Claudia Noonan were ready.
It was the following December, while studying in my library
that I received a telephone call from Claudia who said, "We
just arrived from Mexico City, and the first thing Frank and I
wish to do is to thank you."
"Thank me for what?"
"We want to thank you for our new home in the Jardines del
Pedregal de San Angel."
206
A few days later at dinner Claudia explained, "Late one
Saturday afternoon Frank and I were relaxing at home. Some
friends from the States telephoned and asked if we would
drive them to the Jardines del Pedregal de San Angel.
"It just so happened we were both rather exhausted. And
besides, we had taken them there earlier in the week. Frank
was ready to 'beg off when an expression used in the book
flashed through his mind — Go the extra mile.
"While driving them through this man-made paradise, I saw
the home of my dreams — even the swimming pool I longed
for." (Claudia is the swimming champion, Claudia Eckert.)
"Frank bought it."
Frank said, "You might like to know that although the
property cost in excess of a half million pesos, I only made a
deposit of five thousand pesos. It costs less for our family to
live in the Jardines del Pedregal de San Angel than in our
former home."
"Why is this?" I asked in surprise.
"Well, we bought the two homes that were on the property
instead of one. The rent from the one house is enough to
make payments on the entire enterprise.
Now this wasn't so surprising after all. It's quite common for a
family to buy a duplex apartment and rent one and live in the
other. What is surprising to a person without experience is how
easy it is to get what you want by understanding and applying the
success principles to be found in an autobiography or self-
improvement book.
207
"Attract wealth with PMA," we say. You say: "Money makes
money and I have no money." This is a negative mental attitude.
If you don't have money, use OPM. That's what the next chapter
is all about.
PILOT NO. 12
Thoughts to Steer By
1. If you know your specific destination and take the first step,
you're on your way!
2. The test of your faith is whether you apply it when you are not
in difficulty, as well as at the time of your greatest need.
3. If you don't succeed when you finally read and study Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude, with whom does the fault
lie?
4. The house of your dreams: You can have it! Like Frank and
Claudia Noonan, you may buy two houses and rent one to pay
for both.
5. Do you need to be in an accident or get sick and land in a
hospital to establish the habit of regularly engaging in study,
thinking and planning time regarding your personal, family or
business life?
6. Have you made a start toward achieving desirable goals by: (a)
writing down each goal, (b) setting deadlines for reaching
them, (c) setting high goals, and (d) inspecting your written
statements daily?
7. Where will you be and what will you be doing ten years from
today if you keep on doing what you are doing now?
208
8. The Richest Man in Babylon: This book gives you a proven
formula of success:
(a) Just save one dime out of every dollar you earn.
(b) Each six months invest your savings, and the interest or
dividend returns from these savings and investments.
(c) Before you invest, seek expert advice on safe investments.
(d) If you need the money you are saving for living expenses or
necessities, then work an extra hour (or more) so that you
have no excuse for not saving 10 percent of your earnings.

CHAPTER 13
If You Don't Have Money-
Use OPM!
Business? It is quite simple. It is other people's money!" said
Alexander Dumas the Younger in his play, The Question of
Money.
Yes, it's that simple: use OPM — other people's money. That's
the way to acquire great wealth. Benjamin Franklin did it,
William Nickerson did it, Conrad Hilton did it, Henry J. Kaiser
did it, Colonel Sanders did it, and Ray Kroc did it. And if you are
wealthy, the chances are you did it too.
Now, if you are not wealthy, learn to read what is unwritten. In
fact — rich or poor: read what is unwritten into every platitude,
axiom, or self-motivator. The basic unwritten premise in "Use
OPM" is: that you will operate on the highest ethical standards of
integrity, honor, honesty, loyalty, consent, and the Golden Rule
and apply these in your business relationships.
The dishonest man is not entitled to credit.
And the self-motivator Use OPM implies repayment in full as
agreed with an advantageous consideration or profit to those
whose money is used.
Credit and the use of OPM are one and the same thing. It is the
lack of a satisfactory credit system within country that keeps
backward nations back. Whereas it is the credit system as
practiced in the United States that has developed such great
wealth and progress in this nation. It has been singularly
American.
210
Now the person, corporation or nation that does not have credit
— or does not use it for expansion and progress if they do have it
— is missing an important number in the combination for
success. Therefore take the advice of a wise and successful
businessman like Benjamin Franklin.
Good advice. Advice To a Young Tradesman written in 1748 by
Franklin, discusses the use of OPM as follows:
"Remember, that money is of the prolific, generating nature.
Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more," and
so on.
Also, Franklin said:
"Remember, that six pounds a year is but a groat a day. For this
little sum (which may be daily wasted either in time or expense
unperceived) a man of credit may, on his own security, have the
constant possession and use of an hundred pounds."
Now this statement of Franklin's is a symbol of an idea. His
advice is as good today as when it was written. You can start with
a few cents and have constant pos-session of $500 by employing
it. Or you can expand the idea and have constant possession of
millions of dollars. That is what Conrad Hilton does. He is a man
of credit.
The Hilton Hotels Corporation obtained credit of millions of
dollars to build luxurious motels for air travelers at large airports.
The corporation's collateral: mostly, Hilton's name for honest
dealing.
Honesty is one thing for which a satisfactory substitute has never
been found. It is something which reaches deeper into a human
being than most traits of personality. Honesty, or the lack of it,
211
writes itself indelibly into every word one speaks, into every
thought and deed, and often reflects itself in one's face so that the
most casual observer can sense the quality of sincerity
immediately. The dishonest person, on the other hand, may
announce his weakness in the very tone of his voice, the
expression on his face, in the nature and trend of his
conversations, or in the type of service he renders.
So while this chapter might seem to be one about the use of other
people's money, it also has strong overtones about character in it.
Honesty and reputation, credit and success in business are all
intermixed. The man who has the first of them is well on his way
to gaining the other three.
Make investments with OPM. William Nickerson was another
man of credit and reputation who found: "Money can beget
money, and its offspring can beget more," and so on. He tells
about it in his book. The title tells what he did. The book tells
how he did it.
Nickerson's book is aimed specifically at how to make money
with OPM in your spare time in the real estate field. But almost
everything he has to say also applies to you in your efforts to
acquire wealth by making investments with OPM.
How I Turned $1000 Into $3 Million in My Spare Time is the title
of the book.
"Show me a millionaire," he says, "and I will show you almost
invariably a heavy borrower." To back up his statement, he points
to wealthy men such as Henry Kaiser, Henry Ford, and Walt
Disney.
And we will point to Charlie Sammons who, with bank credit,
developed a forty million dollar business in ten years. But, before
212
we do, let's talk about the people who help men like Conrad
Hilton, William Nickerson, and Charlie Sammons by loaning
them the money they need.
Your banker is your friend. Banks are in business to loan
money. The more they loan to honest men, the more money they
make for themselves. Commercial banks loan money primarily
for business purposes. Thus loans for luxuries are not
encouraged.
Your banker is an expert. And more important, he is your friend.
He wants to help you. For he is one of the people eager to see you
succeed. If the banker knows his business, listen to what he has to
say.
For a person with common sense never underestimates the power
of a borrowed dollar or the advice of an expert. It was the use of
OPM and a successful plan — plus the PMA success principles
of initiative, courage, and common sense — that resulted in an
average American boy named Charlie Sammons becoming
wealthy.
Like some Texans, Charlie Sammons of Dallas is a millionaire.
In fact, like some other Texans, he is a multimillionaire. Yet at
the age of 19, he was no better off financially than most teenage
boys except that he had worked and saved some money.
One of the officers in the bank where Charlie regularly deposited
his savings each Saturday took an interest in him. For the banker
felt: now here's a boy of character and ability — and he knows
the value of money.
So when Charlie decided to go in business for himself, buying
and selling cotton, the banker gave him credit. And this was the
first experience Charlie Sammons had in the use of OPM. As you
213
will see, it was not the last. He learned then, and has seen it
confirmed since:
Your banker is your friend.
About a year and a half after he became a cotton broker, the
young man became a horse and mule trader. It was then that he
learned much about human nature.
And his understanding of people in addition to his knowledge of
money soon developed in Charlie Sammons a very sound
philosophy of a brand commonly observed in persons who are, or
will be, successful. Charlie learned this philosophy at an early
age. He has never lost it. Today he still maintains it.
This brand of philosophy is known as: common sense.
After he had operated a few years as a horse and mule trader, two
men came to Charlie and asked him to go to work for them.
These two men had developed a reputation for themselves as
being outstandingly successful in the sale of insurance. They had
come to Charlie because they had learned a lesson from defeat
Here's how it happened...
It seems that after these two salesmen had successfully sold life
insurance over a period of many years, they were motivated to
form a company of their own. They were good salesmen all right.
But they were poor business administrators. In fact, they were
such good salesmen that they sold their company out of business.
Now it is not uncommon for salesmen to assume that financial
success in a business is contingent only on sales. But this is a
false premise. A poor administration can lose money as fast, or
faster, than a good sales management and sales force can bring it
214
in. Their trouble was that neither one of these men was a good
administrator.
But they had learned their lesson — the hard way. On the day
they went to see Charlie, one of the salesmen told their story of
defeat and said:
"Since our company went broke, we have paid off our losses
from the commissions we have since made selling insurance. We
also had to pay for our living. It has taken a mighty long time but
— we have done it.
"We know we are good salesmen. And we also know now that we
should keep to our own specialty — selling." He hesitated,
looked into the eyes of the young man and continued:
"Charlie, you have your feet on the ground. You have good
common horse sense and we need you. Together we can
succeed."
And they did.
A plan and OPM developed a $40,000,000 volume. A few years
later Charlie Sammons bought all of the shares of the company he
and these two men had formed. How did he get the money? He
used OPM plus what he had saved. Where did he get the large
amount of money that he needed? He borrowed it from a bank, of
course. Remember: he had learned early that his banker was his
friend.
And then in the year that his company had produced an annual
premium volume of almost $400,000, the insurance executive
finally found the success formula for rapid expansion that he had
long been looking for.
He was ready.

It was this formula plus OPM that developed a forty million
dollar premium volume in a single year. Samnions had seen that
an insurance company in Chicago had successfully developed a
sales plan through "leads."
Now for many years sales managers had used what is termed the
"lead system" to promote a new business. And with sufficient
good leads salesmen often earn exceedingly large incomes.
Inquiries from individuals who indicate an interest are called
"leads." These are generally obtained from some form of
promotional advertising program.
Perhaps you know from experience that with human nature being
what it is, many salesmen are timid or afraid to try to sell persons
whom they don't know or with whom they have had no previous
personal contact or communication. Because of this fear, they
waste a lot of time that could be used in selling prospects.
But even an ordinary salesman will be motivated to call on as
many prospects as he has leads. For he knows that many sales can
be made even though he himself may have little sales training or
experience — when he is furnished good leads. And besides he
has an address and a specific person to see there. He believes the
prospect is somewhat interested before he interviews him.
Therefore he is not as fearful as he would be if he were forced to
try to sell a person without any preconditioning whatsoever.
Some companies build their entire sales program on such leads.
And advertising is used to obtain them.
But advertising costs money.
Charlie Samnions knew where to go to get the money when he
had a good bankable idea — the Republic National Bank of
Dallas. For it is well known in Texas that this bank helped build
216
Texas. And it is in the business to loan money to men of integrity
like Charlie Samnions who have a plan and know how to work it.
Now while it is true that some bankers won't take the time to
learn their client's business, Oran Kite and other officers of the
Republic National do. Charlie explained his plan to them. And, as
a result, he was able to employ unlimited credit to build his
insurance business through the lead system.
You see, it was because of the American credit system that
Charlie Samnions was able to build the Reserve Life Insurance
Company. And under such a system he was able to develop a
premium volume from four hundred thousand dollars to over
forty million within the short space of ten years. Again because
he used OPM in his investments, he is able to invest and own
controlling interest in hotels, office buildings, manufacturing
plants and other enterprises.
But you don't need to go to Texas to use OPM. W. Clement Stone
bought an insurance company with one million six hundred
thousand dollars in assets, using the seller's own money. He went
to Baltimore.
How W. Clement Stone bought a $1,600,000 company with the
seller's own money. This is how he describes the purchase:
It was the year-end, and I was engaging in study, thinking, and
planning time. I determined that my major objective for the
following year would be to own an insurance company that was
licensed to operate in several states. I set a deadline as to when
this was to be accomplished: December 31st of the next year.
Now I knew what I wanted and a date was set for its
achievement. But I didn't know how I could get it. This wasn't
really important, for I believed that I could find a way. Therefore
217
I must, I thought, look for a company that would fulfill my
requirements: (1) that it have a charter to sell accident and health
insurance, and (2) that it be licensed to operate in nearly all the
states. I didn't need established business. Just a vehicle.
Of course, there was the problem of money. But I would face
that problem when it arose. Even then it occurred to me that I
was a salesman by vocation and therefore I could, if it should
become necessary, work out a three-way deal: a contract to buy
the company; reinsure the entire business with some large
company; and thus own everything but the insurance in force.
These other insurance companies were willing to pay a good
price for established business. I didn't need established business.
I had the experience and ability to build an accident and health
business as long as I had the vehicle. I had already proved this by
building a national insurance sales organization.
And then I made the next step: I asked for Divine guidance and
help.
While analyzing the immediate problems with which I might be
faced, it occurred to me that I should let the world know what I
wanted, and the world would help me. (Now this conclusion was
not in conflict with the principles laid down by Napoleon Hill in
Think and Grow Rich wherein he states that you keep your definite
objectives a secret except to members of your mastermind
alliance. When I found the company that I wished to buy, I
would, of course, follow his suggestion and keep the negotiations
a secret from the world until I closed the deal.)
So I let the world know what I wanted. Every time I met a
person in the industry who might give me information, I told
him what I was looking for.
Joe Gibson of Excess Insurance was such a person. I had met
him on just one occasion.
218
The new year was started with enthusiasm as I had a big
objective and I set out to reach it. One month passed. Two. Six
months passed. At last ten months had gone by. And although I
had checked into many possibilities, none fulfilled my two basic
requirements.
Then one Saturday in the month of October when I was seated
at my desk with my papers pushed back, engaged in study,
planning, thinking time, I checked off the list of my objectives
for the year. All had been achieved but one — the important
one.
Just two months to go, I said to myself. There is a way. While I
don't know what it is, I know I'll find it. For it never occurred to
me that my aim could not be reached or that it wouldn't be
reached within the time limit specified. There is always a way, I
said to myself. Again, as on similar occasions, I asked for Divine
guidance and help.
Now two days later something unexpected happened. I was again
seated at my desk. This time I was busy dictating. The telephone
rang a disturbing note at my elbow. I picked up the receiver and
a voice said: "Hello, Clem. This is Joe Gibson." Our
conversation was short, and I will never forget it. Joe talked
rapidly:
"I thought you would be interested in knowing that the
Commercial Credit Company of Baltimore will probably
liquidate the Pennsylvania Casualty Company because of its
tremendous losses. Of course, you know Commercial Credit
owns Pennsylvania Casualty. There will be a meeting of the
Board of Directors next Thursday in Baltimore. All the
Pennsylvania Casualty Company's business is already being re-
insured by two other insurance companies owned by
Commercial Credit. The name of the executive vice president of
Commercial Credit is E. H. Warheim."
219
I thanked Joe Gibson warmly, asked him one or two more
questions, and then hung up the phone. After a few minutes of
thought it flashed into my mind that if I could conceive a plan
whereby Commercial Credit Company would accomplish its
objectives more quickly and with greater certainty than under its
proposed plan, it shouldn't be difficult to persuade the directors
to accept such a plan.
I didn't know Mr. Warheim, and therefore was hesitant to call
him, but I felt that speed was of the essence. And then two self-
motivators forced me to act.
Where there is nothing to lose by trying and everything to gain if successful,
all means try. Do It Now!
And without a second's further hesitation, I picked up the phone
and placed a long distance call to E. H. Warheim in Baltimore.
"Mr. Warheim," I began with a smile in my voice. "I have some
good news for you!"
And then I introduced myself and explained that I had heard of
the possible action to be taken regarding the Pennsylvania
Casualty Company and that I thought I would be in a position to
help them reach their objectives more quickly. Then and there I
made an appointment to see Mr. Warheim and his associates the
following day at 2 p.m. in Baltimore.
At 2 p.m. the next day W. Russell Arlington, my attorney, and I
met with Mr. Warheim and his associates.
Pennsylvania Casualty Company fulfilled my needs. It had a
charter permitting it to operate in 35 states. It had no insurance
in force as the business had already been reinsured by other
companies. By making the sale, Commercial Credit Company
accomplished its objectives quickly and with certainty. In
addition they received $25,000 from me for the charter.
220
Now the company had $1,600,000 in liquid assets: negotiable
securities and cash. How did I get the one million six hundred
thousand dollars? I used OPM. It happened this way:
"What about the one million six hundred thousand dollars in
assets?" Mr. Warheim asked.
I was ready for the question and immediately responded:
"Commercial Credit Company is in the business of lending
money. I will just borrow the one million six hundred thousand
dollars from you."
We all laughed, and then I continued: "You have everything to gain
and nothing to lose. For everything I own will be behind the loan,
including the one million six hundred thousand dollar company
that I am now buying.
"Besides, you are in the business of lending money. And what
better security could you have than the pledge of the company
you are selling me? In addition, you will receive interest on the
loan.
"What is most important to you is that this way you will solve
your problem swiftly and with certainty."
When I hesitated, Mr. Warheim asked another very important
question: "How are you going to repay the loan?"
And I was ready for that question too. My response was: "I will
repay the entire loan in sixty days.
"You see, I don't need more than a half million dollars to operate
an accident and health company in the 35 states in which
Pennsylvania Casualty Company is licensed.
221
"As the company will be wholly owned by me, all I need to do is
to reduce the capital and surplus of Pennsylvania Casualty
Company from one million six hundred thousand dollars to five
hundred thousand dollars, which I can then apply to my loan
with you.
"You and I know that a businessman is faced with the matter of
income taxes on any transaction involving income or
expenditures. But no income tax payments will be required on
this transaction for the simple reason that the Pennsylvania
Casualty Company has not made profits, and no part of the
money I receive when I reduce the capital will, therefore, be
from profits."
And then another question was asked me: "What about your
plans to repay the balance of the half million dollars?"
Again I was prepared to answer and said: "This should be easy.
The Pennsylvania Casualty Company has assets consisting only
of cash, government bonds, and high grade securities. I can
borrow the half million dollars from the banks with which I have
been doing business by pledging my interest in Pennsylvania
Casualty Company and my other assets as additional security to
back the loan."
When Mr. Arrington and I left the office of Commercial Credit
Company at 5:00 p.m., the deal was closed.
Now this experience is related in detail here to illustrate the steps
one takes to achieve his aims through the use of OPM. If you will
refer to Chapter Eleven entitled "Is There a Short Cut to Riches?"
you will see how the principles mentioned there were applied
here.
222
While this story indicates how the use of OPM can help a person,
credit can sometimes be harmful.
Warning — credit can hurt you. So far we have been talking
about the benefits of the use of credit. We have been talking
about the practice of borrowing money for the purpose of making
money. This is capitalism. This is good.
But that which is good can be harmful to a person with a negative
mental attitude. Credit is no exception. And credit may make a
person who has been honest become dishonest. The abuse of
credit is one of the main sources of worry, frustration,
unhappiness, and dishonesty.
Now we are talking about credit given voluntarily by a creditor.
He gives credit to a person who he thinks has the quality of being
worthy, on whose truthfulness he can rely. The one who betrays
such a trust is dishonest. Such a person is the one who will
borrow money or purchase merchandise without the intent to
make the payments agreed upon or to pay the loan in full.
Likewise, the honest person can become dishonest when he
neglects to repay the loans he makes, or pay for the merchandise
he buys, even though circumstances may prevent him from
making a payment on the due date.
For the man under the influence of the PMA side of his talisman
will have the courage to face the truth. He will have the courage
to notify his creditors as far in advance as possible when
circumstances prevent him from making a payment. And then he
will work out some satisfactory arrangement by mutual consent
with his creditor. Above everything else, he will sacrifice until
his obligation is finally fully paid.
223
The honest man with common sense does not abuse credit
privileges.
The honest man who lacks common sense will borrow or
purchase on credit indiscriminately. And then because he sees no
way to pay his creditors, the NMA influence of his talisman
exerts such a terrific force on him that he may become dishonest.
He may feel his situation is hopeless and he can do nothing about
it. He realizes that he won't be thrown into jail for owing
borrowed money. Although he thinks he is not going to be
punished, in reality his worries, fears, and frustrations are a very
real punishment.
And he remains dishonest until he comes under the strong
influences of the PMA side of his talisman — influences strong
enough to cause him to clear his obligations in full.
The abuse of credit privileges has literally brought on physical,
mental, and moral illness. Remember Necessity, NMA, and Crime
in Chapter Three entitled "Clear the Cobwebs From Your
Thinking."
Warning — OPM and cycles. As a very young salesman in the
early part of 1928, W. Clement Stone called on an officer at the
Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in
Chicago. The banker was talking to a customer or friend. While
the young salesman was waiting, he overheard him say, "The
market just can't keep going up forever. I'm selling my shares."
Some of the keenest investors in the country lost fortunes when
the stock market crashed the following year — all because they
lacked the knowledge of cycles, or, if they had the knowledge,
they, unlike the banker, failed to act.
224
Tens of thousands of individuals engaging in all forms of
business enterprises, including farming, lost their wealth — even
though they were honest, prudent persons. Their wealth was
acquired through OPM. As their securities increased in value,
they borrowed more money to purchase more securities, farmland
or other assets.
When the market value of their securities fell, they were unable to
pay when the banks were forced to call in their loans.
Cycles repeat with regularity. So, in the first half of the 1970s,
thousands of honest, prudent persons again lost their wealth
because they didn't clear their loans in time by selling a portion of
their securities — or didn't refrain from going further into debt to
make additional purchases. When you use OPM, be certain to
calculate how you can and will pay the individual or institution
that loaned you the money.
Important: If you have lost a portion or all of your wealth,
remember that cycles repeat. Don't hesitate to start over again at
the proper time. Many wealthy persons today lost fortunes
previously. But because they didn't lose their PMA, they had the
courage to learn from their experiences and, subsequently,
acquired even greater wealth.
If you would like to learn more about cycles, refer to Cycles —
The Mysterious Forces That Trigger Events, by Edward R.
Dewey and Og Mandino. You may find it exceedingly profitable.
You can keep abreast of the theories and experiments on cycles
by subscribing to Cycles magazine (write to 124 S. Highland
Ave., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.)
In business, there are very few numbers necessary in the
combination to success, but if one or more of the numbers are
missing, you will fail until you find the missing numbers.
225
The use of other people's money has been the means whereby
honest men who were poor became rich. Money or credit is an
important number in the combination to business success.
The missing number. A young sales manager, whose yearly
earnings are in excess of $35,000, wrote:
"I have a feeling: the type of feeling one would have if he were
standing in front of a safe which held all the wealth, happiness,
and success in the world, and he had all the numbers to the
combination — except one. Just one number! If he had it, he
could open the door."
Often the difference between poverty and wealth lies in the
employment of all principles in a formula but one. Just that one
missing number makes the difference!
This can be illustrated in the experience of another man who had
been successful in selling cosmetics for a manufacturer before he
went into business for himself.
In his own business Leonard Lavin, like any man who starts from
the bottom, was faced with problems. As you will see later, that
was good. It was good because he had to study, think, plan, and
work hard before he found a solution to each problem.
Bernice, his wife, and he formed a perfect mastermind alliance.
And they worked together in perfect harmony. They
manufactured one cosmetic item and acted as distributors for
other companies. But they lacked working capital so they were
forced to do the work themselves.
As their business grew, Bernice became an expert in office
management and purchasing, and an excellent administrator.
Leonard became a successful sales manager and efficient
production manager. And when the business grew, they were
226
wise enough to employ the services of a lawyer with good
common sense — the kind that gets things done. And they also
benefited from the services of an expert in accounting and taxes.
The way to make a fortune is to manufacture or sell a product or
service (preferably a necessity at a low cost) that repeats. They
did both.
Every dollar that could be spared was plowed back into the
business. Necessity motivated them to: study, think, and plan;
make one dollar do the part of many; obtain maximum results
from every working hour; eliminate waste.
Month by month their sales moved forward as Leonard
aggressively sought to break each previous sales record. He
became known in the industry as a man who knew his business.
To many, he became known as a man who learned to go the extra
mile.
Going the extra mile in two instances completely changed the
course of his career for the better.
In the one instance his banker introduced him to three of the
bank's clients who had made an investment in another cosmetic
company. They needed expert advice from someone with good
common sense. And Leonard took the time to help them.
Leonard went the extra mile in doing a good turn for a buyer in a
drug store in Los Angeles. And then one day the buyer showed
his appreciation by confidentially informing Leonard that the firm
manufacturing VO-5, a quality hair dressing, might be for sale.
Leonard got excited. For here was a 15-year-old company with a
quality product that had leveled off. He knew, from his cosmetic
experience and from the study of cycles and trends, that all this
company needed was new life, new blood, new activity.
227
He acted on the self-starter Do It Now! In fact that very evening
he was in conference with the owner. Now ordinarily in a
transaction of this type, where the buyer and seller don't know
each other, it takes weeks and sometimes months to negotiate —
before there is a meeting of the minds. A pleasing personality and
good common sense on the part of the buyer or seller often
eliminate unnecessary delays. Because of Leonard's pleasing per-
sonality and his good common sense, the owner agreed to sell the
company for $400,000 that same night.
Now it is true that Leonard had been doing well but it was also
true that every dollar he could spare was being plowed back into
his business. Where could he get $400,000?
In his hotel room that night he realized that he had all of the
combinations to real wealth but one. Just one — money.
The next morning, as he awakened, he had a flash of inspiration.
Again he reacted to the self-starter Do It Now! For he made a
long distance telephone call to one of the three men to whom he
was introduced by his banker. He had helped them and perhaps
they could give him the right advice. For they knew more about
financing than he. Because they had invested in another cosmetic
company, perhaps they would invest in his. They did.
And because these men were experienced in investing, they
employed a successful investment formula which made it
necessary for Leonard to agree to: (a) Consolidate all his
operations; (b) devote his entire efforts to one corporation; (c)
have the corporation pay back the loan on quarterly installments
over a five-year period; (d) pay at the going rate of interest on
the loan; and (e) give 25% of the corporation's stock as a
premium for the investment gamble.
228
Leonard did agree. He saw the value of the use of OPM. The
three men used OPM, too. They borrowed the $400,000 from
their banks.
The missing number — now Leonard and Bernice had it! They
worked long hours. They put then: hearts into the business. They
found it a thrilling game.
It wasn't long before VO-5 was being used in every part of the
United States and in many foreign countries.
December is usually the slowest month of the year for the
cosmetic manufacturer. But in December, a year and a half after
Leonard and Bernice took over the management of VO-5 and
another product which was acquired — Rinse Away — the
factory had a dollar volume of more than $870,000. That was as
much as VO-5 and Rinse Away together had received during their
past years under previous management.
And Bernice and Leonard found the missing number. With it they
found the combination to acquire wealth. For it was only three
years after the acquisition of VO-5 that their equities in their
company were valued in excess of a million dollars.
Now the numbers in Leonard Lavin's combination for success
were:
No. 1: A product or service that repeats.
No. 2: A company that is making money with an exclusive
product or trade name, but which has leveled off.
No. 3: A good experienced production manager who operates
the factory with maximum efficiency,
229
No. 4: A successful experienced sales manager who constantly
increases sales (at a profit to the company) by adhering
to a successful sales formula and simultaneously seeking
better sales methods.
No. 5: A good administrator with PMA.
No. 6: An expert accountant who understands cost accounting
and income tax law.
No. 7: A good lawyer with common sense and PMA who gets
things done.
No. 8: Sufficient working capital or credit to operate the business
and expand it at the right time.
You, too, can use OPM for: "Business? It is quite simple. It is
other people's money."
Now if you choose to learn the principles in this chapter as well
as those in Chapter Twelve entitled "Attract — Don't Repel —
Wealth," you, like Leonard and Bernice Lavin, can find the
missing numbers to unlock the door to riches for yourself.
But to be healthy and happy, you must find satisfaction in your
job. When you read the next chapter, you will learn how.
PILOT NO. 13
Thoughts to Steer By
1. "Business? It is quite simple. It is other people's money!"
2. OPM: other people's money is the way to acquire wealth.
230
3. The basic unwritten premise in "Use OPM" is: operate on the
highest ethical standards of integrity, honor, honesty, loyalty,
consent, and the Golden Rule.
4. The dishonest man is not entitled to credit.
5. Your banker is your friend.
6. Where there is nothing to lose by trying, and a great deal to
gain if successful, by all means try!
7. When you want to make a deal with someone, develop a plan
that will give him what he wants, and in doing so get what you
want. A good deal is mutually advantageous.
8. Credit used indiscriminately can hurt you. Abuse of credit is
the cause of much frustration, misery and dishonesty.
9. To unlock the combination to success, you must know all the
necessary numbers. Just one missing number may keep you
from achieving your goal.
10. You too can find the missing numbers and unlock the door to
riches for yourself.
11. Learn about cycles in order to know when to expand, and
when to make and pay off loans.
HAVE THE COURAGE

FACE THE TRUTH!

CHAPTER 14
How to Find Satisfaction
in Your Job
No matter what your job may be — boss or employee; plant
manager or factory worker; doctor or nurse; lawyer or secretary;
teacher or student; housewife or maid — you owe it to yourself to
find satisfaction in your job as long as you have it.
You can, you know. Satisfaction is a mental attitude. Your own
mental attitude is the one thing you possess over which you alone
have complete control. You can determine to find satisfaction in
your job, and discover the way to do so.
You are more apt to find satisfaction in your job if you do "what
comes naturally" — that for which you have a natural aptitude or
liking. When you take a job that doesn't "come naturally" you
may experience mental and emotional conflicts and frustrations.
You can, however, neutralize and eventually overcome such
conflicts and frustrations — if you use PMA, and if you are
motivated to gain experience to become proficient in the job.
Jerry Asam has PMA. And Jerry Asam loves his work. He finds
satisfaction in his job.
Who is Jerry Asam? What does he do?
Jerry is a descendant of the Hawaiian kings. The job he loves so
much is that of sales manager for the Hawaiian office of a large
organization.
Jerry loves his work because he knows his work well and is very
proficient in it. Thus, he is doing what comes naturally. But even
so, Jerry has days when things could be a little rosier. In sales
232
work, days like this can be disturbing — if one does not study,
think, and plan to correct difficulties and to maintain a positive
mental attitude. So Jerry reads inspirational, self-help action
books.
Jerry had read such inspirational books and learned three very
important lessons:
1. You can control your mental attitude by the use of self-
motivators.
2. If you set a goal, you are more apt to recognize things that will
help you achieve it than if you don't set a goal. And the higher
you set your goal, the greater will be your achievement if you
have PMA.
3. To succeed in anything, it is necessary to know the rules and
understand how to apply them. It is necessary to engage in
constructive thinking, study, learning and planning time with
regularity.
Jerry believed these lessons. He got into action. He tried them out
himself. He studied his company's sales manuals, and practiced
what he learned in actual selling, He set his goals — high goals
— and achieved them. And each morning he said to himself: "I
feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific!" And he did feel healthy,
happy, and terrific. And his sales results were terrific too!
When Jerry was sure he himself was proficient in his sales work,
he gathered about himself a group of sales- men and taught them
the lessons he had learned. He trained the men in the latest and
best selling methods as set forth in his company's training
manuals. He took them out personally and demonstrated how
easy it is to sell if one uses the right methods, has a plan, and
approaches each day with a positive mental attitude. He taught
them to set high sales goals and to achieve them with PMA.
233
Every morning Jerry's group meets and recites enthusiastically, in
unison: "I feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific!" Then they
laugh together, slap one another on the back for good luck, and
each one goes his way to sell his quota for the day. Each man sets
a goal and he sets it so high that older, more experienced
salesmen and sales managers on the mainland are amazed.
At the end of each week every salesman turns in a sales report
that makes the president and sales manager of Jerry's organization
smile big, broad smiles.
Are Jerry and the men under him happy and satisfied in their
jobs? You bet they are! And here are some of the reasons they are
happy:
1. They have studied their work well; they know and understand
the rules and techniques and how to apply them so well that
what they are doing comes naturally to them.
2. They set their goals regularly and they believe they will make
them. They know that what the mind of man can conceive
and believe, the mind of man can achieve with PMA.
3. They keep a positive mental attitude continually by using self-
motivators.
4. They enjoy the satisfaction that comes with a job well done.
"I feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific!" Another young
salesman in the same organization on the mainland learned to
control his mental attitude through the use of Jerry Asam's self-
motivator. He was an eighteen-year-old college student who was
working during his summer vacation selling insurance on a cold-
canvass basis in stores and offices. Some of the things he had
learned during his two-week theoretical training period were:
234
1. The habits that a salesman develops within the first two weeks
after leaving the sales school will follow him throughout his
career.
2. When you have a sales target — keep trying until you hit it.
3. Aim higher.
4. In your moment of need, use self-motivators such as: I feel
healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific! to motivate yourself to positive
action in the desired direction.
After he had a few weeks' selling experience, he set a specific
target of achievement. He aimed to win an award. To qualify, it
was necessary to make a minimum of one hundred sales in a
single week.
By Friday night of that week, he had succeeded in making eighty
sales — twenty short of his target. The young salesman was
determined that nothing would stop him from achieving his
objective. He believed what he had been taught: What the mind of
man can conceive and believe, the mind of man can achieve with
PMA. Although the other salesmen in his group closed their
week's work on Friday night, he was back on the job early
Saturday morning.
By three o'clock in the afternoon, he hadn't made a sale. He had
been taught that sales are contingent upon the attitude of the
salesman — not the prospect.
He remembered the Jerry Asam self-motivator and repeated it
five times with enthusiasm. I feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel
terrific!
About five o'clock that afternoon he had made three sales. He
was only seventeen from his goal. He remembered that Success is
235
achieved by those who try and maintained by those who keep
trying with PMA! Again he repeated several times with
enthusiasm, / feel healthy! I feel happy! I feel terrific! About
eleven o'clock that night — he was tired, but he was happy! He
had made his twentieth sale for the day! He had hit his target! He
had won the award and learned that failure can be turned into
success by — keeping on trying.
Mental attitude makes the difference. So it was mental attitude
that motivated Jerry Asam and the salesmen under him to find
satisfaction in their jobs. It was a controlled positive mental
attitude which helped the young student earn the reward and
satisfaction he sought.
Just look about you. Notice those people who enjoy their work
and those who don't. What's the difference between them? Happy,
satisfied persons control their mental attitude. They take a
positive view of their situation. They look for the good, and when
something isn't so good, they look first to themselves to see if
they can improve it. They try to learn more about their work so
that they can become more proficient and make their work more
satisfying to themselves and their employer.
But those who are unhappy clutch their NMA tightly. Indeed, it is
almost as if they want to be unhappy. They look for everything
about which they can complain: the hours are too long; lunch
hours are too short; the boss is too crabby; the company doesn't
give enough holidays or the right kind of bonuses. Or maybe they
even complain about irrelevant things, such as: Susie wears the
same dress every day; John the bookkeeper doesn't write legibly,
and so on, and so on. Anything — just so they can be unhappy.
And they succeed very well, too. They are decidedly unhappy
people — on the job and generally elsewhere too. NMA
possesses them entirely.
236
And this is true regardless of the type of work involved. If you
want to be happy and satisfied, you can be: you will control your
mental attitude and reverse your talisman from NMA to PMA;
you will look for ways and means to create happiness.
If you can bring happiness and enthusiasm into your work
situation, you'll be making a contribution that few others could
equal. You will make your work fun and your job satisfaction
will be measured in smiles — and in productivity, too.
A definite goal made her enthusiastic. In one of our classes, we
were talking about this principle of bringing enthusiasm into
one's job, when a young lady in the rear of the classroom raised
her hand. She got to her feet and said:
"I've come here with my husband. What you say may be all right
for a man in business, but it's no good for a housewife. You men
have new and interesting challenges every day. But it's not like
that with housework. The trouble with housework is... it's just too
darned daily."
This seemed like a real challenge to us: there are a lot of people
who have jobs that are "just too darned daily." If we could find
some way to help this young lady, perhaps we could help others
who thought their work was routine. We asked her what made her
housework seem so "daily," and it turned out that she had no
sooner finished making the beds when they were dirtied again,
washing the dishes when they were soiled again, cleaning the
floors when they were muddied again. "You just get these things
done so they can get undone," she said.
"It does seem frustrating," the instructor agreed. "Are there any
women who do enjoy housework?"
"Well, yes, I guess there are," she said.
237
"What do they find in housework to interest them and keep them
enthusiastic?"
After a moment's thought the young woman replied, "Maybe it's
their attitude. They don't seem to think their work is confining;
they seem to see something beyond the routine."
This was the crux of the problem. One of the secrets of job
satisfaction is being able to "see beyond the routine." It is
knowing that your work is leading somewhere. This is true
whether you are a housewife or a file clerk, a gasoline pump
operator or the president of a large corporation. You'll find
satisfaction in routine chores only when you see them as stepping
stones. Each chore I a stone, leading in a direction that you
choose.
Use the step-stone theory. The answer, then, for this young
housewife, was to find some goal which she really wanted to
achieve, and to find a way to make her routine daily housework
lead to the attainment of that goal. She volunteered the
information that she had always wanted to take her family on a
trip around the world.
"All right," the instructor said. "We'll settle on that Now, set
yourself a time limit. When do you want to go?"
"When the baby is twelve years old," she said. "That will be six
years from now."
"Now, let's see. This will take a little doing. You will need
money, for one thing. Your husband will have to be able to take
off for a year. You will have to plan an itinerary. You will want
to study up on the countries you will be visiting. Do you suppose
you can find a way to let bed-making, dish-washing, floor-
238
scrubbing, and meal-planning be stepping stones toward your
goal?"
A few months later the lady in this story came to see us. It was
apparent the minute she walked into the room that here was a
woman who had succeeded proudly.
"It's amazing," she told us, "how well this stepping-stone idea has
worked! I haven't found a single chore that doesn't fit in. I use my
cleaning time as a thinking and planning time. Shopping time is a
wonderful time to expand our horizons: I deliberately buy foods
from other countries: foods that we will be eating on our trip.
And I use the meal time as a teaching time. If we are having
Chinese egg noodles, I read all I can find about China and its
people, and then at dinner I tell the family all about them.
"Not one of my duties is dull or uninteresting to me anymore.
And I know they never will be again, thanks to the step-stone
theory!"
So no matter how humdrum or tiresome your job may be, if at the
end of it you see a goal that you desire, that job can bring
satisfaction to you. This is a situation which confronts many
persons in all walks of life. One young man may want to be a
doctor, but he has to work his way through school. The job he
takes will be decided by many factors, such as hours, location,
rate of pay, and so on. Aptitude will have little to do with it. A
very intelligent, ambitious, young man may end up behind a soda
fountain, washing cars, or digging ditches. Certainly the job
offers him no challenge or stimulation. It is merely a means to an
end. Yet because he knows he is going where he wants to go, to
him whatever strains the job may impose on him are worth the
end result.
239
Sometimes, however, the price to be paid on a given job is too
high in relation to the goal which it will purchase. And if such a
job should happen to be yours, change your job. For if you are
unhappy at your job, the poisons of this dissatisfaction spread
into every phase of living.
If, however, the job is worth the price but you are still unhappy,
develop inspirational dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction can be
positive or negative, good or bad, depending upon the
circumstances. Remember: A positive mental attitude is the right
mental attitude in a given situation.
Develop inspirational dissatisfaction! Charles Becker, former
president of Franklin Life Insurance Company, says: "I would
urge that you be dissatisfied. Not dissatisfied in the sense of
disgruntlement, but dissatisfied in the sense of that 'divine
discontent' which throughout the history of the world has
produced all real progress and reform. I hope you will never be
satisfied. I hope you will constantly feel the urge to improve and
perfect not only yourself, but the world around you."
Inspirational dissatisfaction can motivate persons from sinner to
saint, failure to success, poverty to riches, defeat to victory, and
misery to happiness.
What do you do: when you make a mistake? when things go
wrong? when misunderstandings develop with others? when you
meet defeat? when everything seems black? when it appears that
there is no way to turn? when it looks as if a satisfactory solution
to your problem is impossible?
Do you: Do nothing and allow disaster to overtake you? Do you
fold up? Become frightened? Run away?
240
Or, do you develop inspirational dissatisfaction? Do you turn
disadvantages into advantages? Do you determine what you
want? Do you apply faith, clear thinking, and positive action,
knowing that desirable results can and will be achieved?
Napoleon Hill says every adversity has the seed of an equivalent
benefit. Isn't it true that in the past what seemed to be a great
difficulty or an unfortunate experience has inspired you to
success and happiness that might not otherwise have been
achieved?
Inspirational  dissatisfaction   can   motivate   you   to   succeed.
Albert Einstein was dissatisfied because Newton's laws didn't
answer all his questions. So he kept inquiring into nature and
higher mathematics until he came up with the theory of relativity
... And from that theory the world has developed the method of
breaking the atom, learned the secret of transmuting energy into
matter and vice versa, and dared and succeeded to conquer space
— and all sorts of amazing things we very likely would not have
accomplished if Einstein had not developed inspirational
dissatisfaction.
Now, of course, we are not all Einsteins, and what results from
our inspirational dissatisfaction may not change the world. But it
can change our world and we can move forward in the direction
we want to go. Let us tell you what happened to Clarence Lantzer
when he became dissatisfied with his job.
Was it worth it? Now Clarence Lantzer had been a streetcar
conductor in Canton, Ohio, for years. And one day he woke up in
the morning and decided that he didn't like his job. It was too
muck the same. He was sick and tired of it. The more Clarence
thought about the matter, the more dissatisfied he became. And
he   seemed   to   be   unable   to   quit   thinking   about   it.   His
241
dissatisfaction grew almost to an obsession. Clarence was
mightily dissatisfied.
But when you have worked for a company as long as Clarence
had worked for his streetcar company, you don't just quit because
you decide that you are unhappy. At least; not if you are
interested in whether or not your bread will be buttered.
Besides, Clarence had taken the PMA Science of Success course,
and he had learned that one could be happy on any job if one
wanted to. The thing to do was to adopt the right attitude.
So Clarence decided to take a sensible view of the situation and
see what he could do about it. "How can I be happier on the job?"
he asked himself.
And he came up with a very good answer indeed. He decided that
he would be happier if he made others happy.
Now there were many people whom he could make happy, for he
met many folks on his streetcar every day. He had always been
able to make friends readily, so he thought: "I'll use this trait to
make each day a little brighter for every person who boards my
car."
Clarence's plan was wonderful — the customers thought. They
enjoyed his little courtesies and cheerful greetings immensely.
And they were happier, and so was Clarence, as the result of his
cheerfulness and consideration.
But his supervisor took the opposite attitude. So the supervisor
called Clarence in and warned him to stop all this unwonted
affability.
242
But Clarence paid no attention to the warning. He was having a
good time making others happy. And as far as he and the
customers were concerned, he was making a terrific success of
his job.
Clarence was fired!
So Clarence had a problem — and that was good. At least,
according to the PMA Science of Success course, it was good.
Clarence decided that perhaps he had better visit Napoleon Hill
(who was living in Canton at the time) and see how and why this
problem was so good. He called Mr. Hill and arranged for an
appointment the next afternoon.
"I've read Think and Grow Rich, Mr. Hill, and I've studied the
PMA Science of Success, but somewhere I must have gotten off
on the wrong track." And he told Napoleon Hill what had
happened to him. "Now what do I do?" he concluded.
Napoleon Hill smiled. "Let's look at your problem," he said. "You
were dissatisfied with your work as it was. You did exactly right.
You tried to use your best asset, your friendly and affable
disposition, to do a better job and get and give more satisfaction
on the job. The problem arises from the fact that your superior
didn't have the imagination to see the value of what you were
doing. But that's wonderful! Why? Because now you are in a
position to use your fine personality for even greater goals."
And Napoleon Hill showed Clarence Lantzer that he could use
his fine abilities and friendly disposition to much better
advantage as a salesman than as a streetcar conductor. So
Clarence applied for and got a job as an agent for the New York
Life Insurance Company.
243
The first prospect Clarence called on was the president of the
streetcar company. Clarence turned his personality loose on this
gentleman, and came out of the office with an application for a
$100,000 policy!
The last time Hill saw Lantzer, he had become one of New York
Life's biggest producers.
Are you a square peg in a round hole? The characteristics,
abilities, and capacities that make you happy and successful in
one environment may create an opposite reaction in another. You
have a tendency to do well what you want to do.
You are called a "square peg in a round hole" when you work or
engage in activities that do not come naturally, and that are
inwardly repellent. In such an unhappy situation you can change
your position and place yourself in an environment that is
pleasing to you.
It may not be feasible to change your position. You can then
make adjustments in your environment to coincide with your
characteristics, abilities, and capacities so that you will be happy.
When you do this, you "square the hole." This solution will help
change your attitude from negative to positive.
If you develop and maintain a burning desire to do so, you can
even neutralize and change your tendencies and habits by
establishing new ones. You can "round the peg" if you are
sufficiently motivated. But before you achieve success in
changing your tendencies and habits, be prepared to face mental
and moral conflicts. You can win if you are willing to pay the
price. You may find it difficult to pay each necessary installment
— particularly the first few. But when you have paid in full, the
newly established traits will predominate. The old tendencies and
244
habits will become dormant. You will be happy because you will
be doing what now comes naturally.
To guarantee success it is desirable that you try zealously to
maintain physical, mental, and moral health during the period of
such an internal struggle.
In the next chapter, "Your Magnificent Obsession," you will see
how to neutralize your mental conflicts.

CHAPTER 15
Your Magnificent Obsession
With the idea that we are about to give you, you can have riches
far beyond your fondest hope.
This idea will bring you a wealth of happiness. For your
personality will expand. And you will receive affection and love,
both of a quality and a quantity you have never before dreamed
possible.
This principle was expressed dramatically on many occasions by
the author, Lloyd C. Douglas. When Douglas retired from the
ministry he moved into a more extended form of inspirational
teaching: the writing of novels. His ministry had reached
hundreds; his books reached thousands; his movies, millions.
And to each he preached the same basic message. But it was
never so clearly expressed as in the novel The Magnificent
Obsession. The principle is so obvious here that those who need
it most may not see it at all. It is simply this:
Develop an obsession — a Magnificent Obsession — to help
others.
Share yourself without expecting a reward, payment, or
commendation. And above all else — keep your good turn a
secret.
And, if you do this, you will set in motion the powers of a
universal law. For, try as you will to avoid payment for your
good deed — blessings and rewards will be showered upon you.
No matter who you are, you can have a Magnificent Obsession.
Every living person can help others by sharing a part of himself.
246
You don't have to be rich or powerful to develop a Magnificent
Obsession. Regardless of who you are, or what you have been,
you can create inside yourself a burning desire to be helpful to
others.
Take, for example, the sinner with a magnificent obsession.
You'll never know his name. That's a secret. When he was asked
to help the Boys Clubs of America — an organization the sole
purpose of which is the building of character in children — with a
small donation, he refused. In fact, he was more than rude to the
man who had called to interview him on this occasion.
"Get out!" he said. "I'm sick and tired of people asking me for
money!"
As the representative was walking toward the door to leave, he
stopped, turned around, and looked kindly at the man sitting
behind his desk. "You may not wish to share with the needy. But
I do. I'll share with you a part of what I have — a prayer: May
God bless you." And then he turned swiftly and left.
You see, with a flash of inspiration the Boys Club representative
had remembered: "... silver and gold have I none, but such as I
have give I unto you." And a few days later an interesting thing
happened.
The man who had said, "Get out!" knocked on the door of the
Club representative's office and asked, "May I come in?" He
brought with him a part of what he had to share: a check for half
a million dollars. As he laid the check on the desk, he said: "I am
giving this on one condition: that you never let anyone know that
I did it."
"Why not?" he was asked.
247
"I don't want my name to represent to boys and girls that I am
good. I'm not a saint. For I have been a sinner."
And that is why you'll never know his name. Just he, the Boys
Club representative, and the Greatest Giver of All know the name
of the sinner whose money was donated for the purpose of
helping boys and girls avoid doing the wrong things he had done.
Like the Boys Club representative, you may not have money, but
you can share by giving a part of what you have. And like him,
you can be a part of a great cause. And you, too, when you give,
can give generously.
Your most preciously valued possessions and your greatest
powers are often necessarily invisible and intangible. No one can
take them. You and you alone can share them.
The more you share, the more you will have.
Now if you doubt this, you can prove it to yourself by giving: a
smile to everyone you meet; a kind word; a pleasant response;
appreciation with warmth from the heart; cheer; encouragement;
hope; honor, credit, and applause; good thoughts; evidence of
love for your fellow-men; happiness; a prayer for the godless and
the godly; and time for a worthy cause with eagerness.
If you do experiment by giving any one of the above, you will
also prove to yourself what we have found is one of the most
difficult principles to teach those who need it most: how to cause
desirable actions within yourself. Until you do learn, you will fail
to realize that what is left with you when you share it with others
will multiply and grow; and what you withhold from others will
diminish and decrease. Therefore, share that which is good and
desirable and withhold that which is bad and undesirable.
248
Be a part of a great cause. We know of a mother who lost her
only child: a beautiful, happy, teen-age girl who brought laughter
and inspiration to all who were fortunate enough to know her. In
attempting to neutralize the grief of her loss, this mother
developed a most magnificent obsession and became a part of a
great cause. Today she is among the many thousands of
American women who are making this world a better world to
live in. Because of the wonderful work she is doing and the
beauty of her Magnificent obsession, we wrote and asked her if
she would be land enough to share with us the inspiration which
helped her develop her Magnificent Obsession. Her response
was:
"The searing agony of losing our beloved daughter is never far
away in my mind. Conceived in love and nurtured with love, she
held our entire future and all our hopes in every sense of the
words. The Almighty took our only child from us at the age of
fourteen-and-a-half. It Is impossible to describe our loss. The
bright promise of the future went dull, for the light of our lives
had been snuffed out. Everything that we had lived to the full be-
came empty. All that was sweet turned bitter.
"My husband and I reacted as does everyone. Our very existence
was encompassed by the eternally unanswered question: WHY?
My husband retired, we sold our home, and seeking an escape,
did extensive traveling. Only when we came face to face with the
harsh reality that we couldn't run away from our sadness and our
memories did we return. Slowly, ever so slowly, we recognized
that our loss was not exclusive. We had sought solace and found
none, for our motives were self-centered. It took months for my
mind to begin to accept the fact that all the joys of children and
good health and security are blessings the Almighty loans to each
of us. These infinite mercies which we finite persons presume to
take for granted should each be cherished for their true meaning
and great and irreplaceable value.
249
"How could I earn the right to keep my other blessings? How
could I show my appreciation and thanks to Heaven for allowing
me my husband's love, for living in this great nation of ours, for
my friends and my five unimpaired senses, for all the good things
that surrounded me? Now my efforts to find myself began to
move in the right direction.
"Although bereft of my dearest possession, the Almighty had
given me, in recompense, an empathy with people and a clearer
understanding of the problems besetting each of us.
Proportionately, my own understanding in relation to adjusting to
my loss grew apace, as my service in helping others increased.
"I sought to find the niche in social work that would ultimately
give me the opportunity to leave my small heritage for humanity
in lieu of my beloved daughter and found the answer in City of
Hope.
"Now, as surely as time passes, my peace of mind, call it a
Magnificent Obsession if you will, gains in stature. It is my
earnest wish that all who suffer loss of a loved one can find
comfort and serenity in service to others."
Today the City of Hope, national medical and research center,
renders entirely free patient care. Its services are dispensed on
the highest humanitarian level in the belief that "Man is his
brother's keeper." This wonderful mother found peace of mind in
a truly Magnificent Obsession.
The entire nation — in fact the entire world — can be affected
by the Magnificent Obsession of just one man who wants to share
a part of what he has. Orison Swett Marden was a man who
shared a part of what he had and developed a Magnificent
Obsession that changed the attitude of people from negative to
positive.
250
The seeds of thought in a book grew into a Magnificent
Obsession. At the age of seven Orison Swett Marden became an
orphan. He was "bound out" for his room and board. At an early
age he read Self-Help, by the Scottish author Samuel Smiles who,
like Marden, had become an orphan as a young boy and had
found the secrets of true success. The seeds of thought in Self-
Help created a burning desire in Marden which grew into his
magnificent obsession and made his world a better world in
which to live.
During the boom that preceded the panic of 1893, Marden owned
and operated four hotels. Since their operation was entrusted to
others, he was devoting much of his time to writing a book.
Actually, he was fulfilling a desire to write a book that would
motivate American youth as Self-Help had motivated him. He
was working diligently on his inspirational manuscript when an
ironical twist of fate struck him and tested his mettle.
Marden entitled his work Pushing to the Front. And he took as
his motto: "Let Every Occasion Be a Great Occasion for You
Cannot Tell When Fate May Be Taking Your Measure for a
Larger Place!"
And at that very instant Fate was taking his measure for a larger
place. The misfortune that struck him would have ruined many a
man. What happened?
The panic of 1893 struck. Two of the Marden hotels burned to the
ground. His manuscript, nearly completed, was destroyed. His
tangible wealth went down the drain, wiped out.
But Marden had a Positive Mental Attitude. He looked about him
to see what had happened to the nation and himself. His first
conclusion was that the panic was brought on by fear: fear of the
value of the American dollar; fear caused by the failure of a few
251
large corporations; fear of stock values; and fear of industrial
unrest.
Those fears caused the stock market to crash. Five hundred and
sixty-seven banks and loan and trust companies, as well as a
hundred and fifty-six railway companies, failed. Strikes were
prevalent. Unemployment affected millons of persons. Because
of drouth and heat, farmers experienced crop failures.
Marden looked about him at the shambles in material things and
human lives. He saw the great need for someone or something to
inspire the nation and its people. Offers came to him to manage
other hotels. He turned them down. A desire had caught hold of
him, a Magnificent Obsession. And he combined it with PMA.
He set to work on a new book. His new motto, a self-motivator:
Every occasion is a great occasion!
"If ever there was a time when America needed the help of a
positive mental attitude, it is now," he told friends.
He worked over a livery stable and lived on one dollar and a half
each week. He worked almost unceasingly, day and night. He
completed the first edition of Pushing to the Front in 1893.
The book received immediate acceptance. It was used extensively
in the public schools as a textbook and as a supplementary reader.
Business houses circulated it among their employees.
Distinguished educators, statesmen and members of the clergy,
merchants, and sales managers commended it as a most powerful
motivator to a positive mental attitude. And, in time, it was
printed in twenty-five different languages. Millions of copies
were sold.
Marden, like the authors of Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude, believed that character is the cornerstone in building
252
and maintaining success. He believed the highest and best
achievements are noble manhood and womanhood, and that the
achievement of true integrity and well-rounded character is in
itself success. He taught the secrets of financial and business
success. But he also entered a perpetual protest against dollar
chasing and over-reaching greed. He taught there is something
infinitely better than making a living: It is making a noble life.
Marden showed how some men may make millions and still be
utter failures. Those who sacrifice their families, reputation,
health — everything — for dollars are failures in life, regardless
of how much money they may accumulate. He also taught that
one may succeed without be coming a president or a millionaire.
Perhaps one of the greatest achievements of Marden's
Magnificent Obsession was the awakening of men and women to
the realization that they could experience success if they would
only employ the virtues they would like their children to have.
Perhaps fully as rewarding to Marden, Pushing to the Front was
instrumental in changing the attitude of an entire nation from
negative to positive. And that influence was felt throughout the
world.
Marden demonstrated that a burning desire can generate the drive
to action that is imperative for great achievement.
As you have seen, it took courage and sacrifice for Orison Swett
Marden to bring his Magnificent Obsession into reality.
A Magnificent Obsession does take courage. You may need to
stand alone in combating and repelling the ridicule and ignorance
of the experts. Like great discoverers, creators, inventors,
philosophers, and geniuses, you may be termed "crazy," "nuts,"
or a "crackpot." The experts may say what you are trying to do
253
can't be done. With time your burning desire and constant effort
will bring your Magnificent Obsession into reality. When they
say, "It can't be done," find a way to do it!
A Magnificent Obsession will conquer in spite of the obstacles
that stand in its way! Many years ago, a student at the University
of Chicago and his friends went to hear a lecture by Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle on spiritualism. They went for a lark. They meant
to scoff. One of these students, J. B. Rhine, was impressed by the
seriousness of the speaker. He began to listen. Certain ideas im-
pressed him. He couldn't dismiss them from his mind. Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle referred to men of great repute who were searching
into the realm of psychic phenomena. J. B. Rhine decided to
investigate and to engage in some research.
In referring to the incident some time ago, Dr. Rhine, Director of
The Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University in North
Carolina, said: "There were things said there that I should have
known as a college student. During and after the lecture I began
to recognize some of them. My education had omitted many of
the things that were important, such as ways of seeking the un-
known. I began to see some of the faults of the educational
system of the day."
He became interested in the freedom of all to secure new
knowledge. He began to resent a system whereby seeking the
truth in any form, or on any issue, became a taboo. He began to
develop a burning desire to learn the truth scientifically regarding
man's psychic powers. His burning desire turned into a
Magnificent Obsession.
Rhine had planned to devote his life to college teaching. He was
warned that he would lose his reputation and that his earning
power as a teacher would be impaired. His friends and college
professors ridiculed him and endeavored to discourage him.
254
Some began to shun him. "I must find out for myself," he told a
scientist friend.
The friend responded: "When you do find out, keep it to yourself!
No one is going to believe!"
He did keep his discoveries to himself until he was able to
develop confirmed scientific proof. Today he is honored and
respected throughout the world.
Over the past forty-five years his battles have been figuratively
knuckle fighting every inch of the ground in combating taboos,
ignorance, antagonism, and ridicule.
One of the greatest obstacles with which Dr. Rhine has been
constantly plagued over the years has been the lack of the
necessary money for expanding his research. At one time, for
example, his only EEG machine was assembled from the remains
of one found in a junk pile.
It had been discarded by a hospital.
Have you ever thought that you can develop a Magnificent
Obsession by becoming a part of a great cause and by sharing a
part of what you have? If you have, you already realize that there
are many college and university professors today whose
Magnificent Obsessions are to seek the truth in various fields so
that all mankind may be benefited by their discoveries. Because
such persons spend all their time in searching for these truths,
they are almost always handicapped by the lack of money to buy
necessary equipment, provide for their own livelihood and the
livings of others engaged in working on the project, etc.
255
You can become a part of such a cause and thus fulfill a
magnificent obsession of your own. You can find such a
dedicated person in almost any college or university.
Money and a Magnificent Obsession! You might ask: How can
we mention money in the same breath with a Magnificent
Obsession? If you did we would respond: "Isn't money good?"
Is money good? Is money good? Many negative-minded persons
say, "Money is the root of all evil." But the Bible says: Love of
money is the root of all evil. And there is a big difference between
the two even though one little word makes the difference.
It has been amazing to the authors to observe negative-minded
persons react unfavorably to Think and Grow Rich and its
contents. For these negative-minded persons might earn in a
single year more than they now earn in a lifetime by changing
their attitude from negative to positive. To do this it would be
necessary to clear the cobwebs from their thinking regarding
money.
In our society money is the medium of exchange. Money is
power. Like all power, money can be used for good or for evil.
Think and Grow Rich has motivated many thousands of its
readers to acquire great wealth through PMA. They have been
inspired in Think and Grow Rich by the biographies of such men
as: Henry Ford, William Wrigley, Henry L. Doherty, John D.
Rockefeller, Thomas Alva Edison, Edward A. Filene, Julius
Rosenwald, Edward J. Bok, and Andrew Carnegie.
Now the men whose names you have just read established
Foundations which even to this day have in the j aggregate in
excess of one billion dollars: money set aside exclusively for
charitable,     religious,     and     educational    purposes.     Today
256
expenditures and grants from these Foundations total in excess of
$200 million in a single year.
Is money good? We know it is.
The Magnificent Obsessions of these men will live in perpetuity.
And the story of the life of Andrew Carnegie will convince the
reader that Carnegie shared with others a part of what he had:
money, philosophy, and something more, In fact, Success
Through a Positive Mental Attitude would not have been written
if it were not for Andrew Carnegie. That is why this book is
dedicated to him, and to you.
Let's talk about him and you. Let's learn from his philosophy.
Let's see how we can apply it in our lives.
A simple philosophy grew into a Magnificent Obsession! A
poor Scottish immigrant boy became the richest man in America.
His inspiring story and motivating philosophy are found in the
Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie.
As a boy and throughout his life Carnegie was motivated by a
simple fundamental philosophy: Anything in life worth having is
worth working fort This simple philosophy grew into a
Magnificent Obsession.
And before he died at the age of eighty-three, Carnegie had
worked diligently for many years to share his great wealth
intelligently with those then living and with future generations.
While he lived, Carnegie was successful in giving approximately
a half billion dollars through direct grants, Foundations, and
trusts.    His    contribution   of   millions    of   dollars    for   the
257
establishment of libraries is a well-known example of the
application of his standard:
Anything in life worth having is worth working for!
And the books in these libraries have been, and will continue to
be, of benefit only to those persons who work to get the
knowledge, understanding, and wisdom they contain by reading
and studying them.
In the year 1908, Napoleon Hill, at the age of eighteen, while
working his way through college as a reporter for a magazine,
interviewed the great steelmaker, philosopher, and philanthropist.
The first interview lasted three hours. And then the great man
invited the youngster to his home.
For three days Carnegie indoctrinated Napoleon Hill with his
philosophy. And be finally inspired the young reporter to devote
at least twenty years of his life to study, research, and find the
simple, underlying principles of success. Andrew Carnegie told
Napoleon Hill that his greatest wealth consisted not in money but
in what he termed — the philosophy of American achievement.
He commissioned Napoleon Hill as his agent to share it with the
world.
And in this book he is sharing it with you.
While he lived, Andrew Carnegie helped Napoleon Hill by giving
him letters of introduction to the great men and women of his
day. He advised him. He shared his thoughts with him. He helped
him in every way, with but one exception — money. For he said,
'Anything in life worth having is worth working for."
Now he knew that this self-motivator, when applied, would
attract happiness and physical, mental, and spiritual health as well
258
as wealth. Everyone can learn and apply Andrew Carnegie's
principles.
It is customary for a man to share a part of his tangible wealth
with his loved ones as he goes through life, or he may do so in his
will. This world would be a better world to live in if each person
would leave, as an inheritance to posterity, the philosophy and
know-how that brought him happiness, physical, mental and
spiritual health and wealth — as did Andrew Carnegie.
The writings of Napoleon Hill make available to you the
principles whereby Carnegie acquired his great wealth. They are
just as applicable to you as they were to him.
Another wealthy man who had a Magnificent Obsession and
shared a part of what he had was Michael L. Benedum. His close
friend, United States Senator Jennings Randolph, told us
Benedum started on a salary of twenty-five dollars a week and
became one of the richest men in America. He was worth over
one hundred million dollars. And yet, the turning point in his
career followed a very very minor incident.
As a young man of twenty-five, Benedum courteously gave his
seat on a train to an elderly stranger. To Benedum it was the
obvious thing to do. And the elderly stranger turned out to be
John Worthington, General Superintendent of the South Perm Oil
Company. In the conversation that followed, Worthington offered
Mike Benedum a job. Benedum accepted and eventually became
"the discoverer of more oil than any other single individual who
ever lived."
Some people say you can judge a man by the philosophy by
which he lives. Mike Benedum's philosophy about money went
something like this: "I'm just a trustee for it and will be held
accountable for the good I can accomplish with it, both in the
259
community as a whole and in behalf of opportunities for people
coming up — even as I was given an opportunity, back when."
Like so many others with a Magnificent Obsession, Benedum
lived to a ripe old age. On his eighty-fifth birthday, he said: "I
have been asked how I keep going at my age. My formula is to
keep busy so that the years go by unnoticed. To despise nothing
except selfishness, meanness, and corruption. To fear nothing
except cowardice, disloyalty, and indifference. To covet nothing
that is my neighbor's except his kindness of heart and his
gentleness of spirit. To think many, many times of my friends
and, if possible, seldom of my enemies. As I see it, age is not a
question of years. It is a state of mind. You are as young as your
faith, and today I think I have more faith in my fellow man, in my
country, and in my God than I have ever had."
You live longer with a Magnificent Obsession. Of course, it's
the old story: the man who has something to live for lives longer.
We realized this when we became well acquainted with men like
the Honorable Herbert Hoover and General Robert E. Wood, who
were doing so much for American youth when they shared their
time and money with the Boys Clubs of America. And they were
long-lived because of their Magnificent Obsessions. They
devoted their thinking and time to projects that benefited others
and, because their lives were the good lives of men with
Magnificent Obsessions, they experienced the pleasure and
therapeutic value of the esteem and love of their fellow men.
Of course, you may not have the material wealth of an Andrew
Carnegie or a Michael L. Benedum but that does not deprive you
of building your own Magnificent Obsession. At least, it didn't
Irving Rudolph.
They're all in jail but my brother and me! Irving devoted his
life to helping boys in blighted neighborhoods. This work was in
260
gratitude for having been saved by a new Boys Club in the rough
neighborhood in which he was raised.
How did Irving Rudolph get started in Boys Club work?
He lived in a poor neighborhood — North Avenue and Halsted
Street in Chicago. He traveled with a tough crowd. There was
plenty of trouble. Plenty of things for boys to get into that they
shouldn't. And not much to occupy their time to keep them out of
trouble. One day a Boys Club was started in an abandoned church
in the neighborhood.
"My brother and I were the only two fellows in our gang who
visited the Club," Irving explained. "They're all in jail but my
brother and me. If it hadn't been for the Lincoln Unit Boys Club,
we'd be there, too."
Irving was grateful for what the Boys Club did for him and his
brother. And he devoted his life to helping boys in blighted
neighborhoods. Through his enthusiasm and zeal, large donations
were received to support the Chicago Boys Clubs. Through him,
men and women of influence were attracted to this cause.
"I feel that my work is only a token payment of my gratitude to a
Higher Power for bringing me and my brother under this
influence," Irving explained. Then he added, "Just visit a Boys
Club. See for yourself the good work that is being done. You will
then feel a part of what I feel for the kids who have the need I
had."
Now there are thousands of men and women who are fulfilling
their Magnificent Obsessions in sacrificing time and money to
help the Boy Scouts of America. Your life has benefited from
their Magnificent Obsessions if...
261
IF.
If you do your best to try never to violate your honor by lying or
cheating and always try to fulfill the responsibility with which
you are entrusted...
If you keep clean in thought and body — if you exemplify clean
habits, clean speech, clean sport — if you associate with a clean
crowd...
If you stand up for the rights of others against the undesirable
influence and coaxing of friends and threats of enemies — if
defeat inspires you to try to succeed — if you have the courage to
face danger in spite of fear...
If you work faithfully and make the best of your opportunities —
if you don't wantonly destroy property — if you save money so
that you can pay your own way in this world and yet be generous
to those in need and give financial help and time to worthy causes
— if you do a good turn each day without expecting
compensation...
If you are a friend to all and a brother to every living man,
woman, and child regardless of race, color, or creed . . .
If you are prepared to learn to know dangers, to avoid negligence
and to know the remedies necessary to help injured persons and
save human lives, to share the duties and responsibilities in your
home and place of business...
If you are polite to all, especially to the weak, helpless, and
unfortunate...
If you will not kill or hurt any living creature needlessly, but
strive to protect all living animals...
262
If you smile when you can, do your work promptly and
cheerfully — and if you never shirk or grumble at responsibilities
or hardships...
If you are loyal to all to whom loyalty is due, to the members of
your family, the firm for which you work and your country...
If you respect duly constituted authorities and obey that which
does not violate your moral code...
If you do your best to do your duty to God and your country, to
help other people at all times, to keep yourself physically strong,
mentally awake, and morally straight...
Then you live and act in response to the imprint in your
subconscious mind of the Oath and Law of the Boy Scouts of
America. What kind of a person would you be if you lived up to
these standards?
America is great because its people live by a great philosophy. It
can be symbolized in the phrase The Great American Heart.
Henry J. Kaiser was another with a Magnificent Obsession. He
did so much to make his world a better world to live in. A
quotation that hung on the wall of a blacksmith shop in England
inspired him as it may also inspire you. It is:
"What! Giving again?" I ask in dismay.
"And must I keep giving and giving away?"
"Oh no," said the angel looking me through,
"Just keep giving till the Master stops giving to you!"
In reading up to this point you started Where the Road to
Achievement Began. You were awakened by Five Mental
Bombshells for Attacking Success. And you have been given the
263
Key to The Citadel of Wealth. Now: Get Ready to Succeed! That
is the purpose of the following chapters.
PILOT NO. 15
Thoughts to Steer By
1. To develop a Magnificent Obsession: Share yourself with
others without expecting a reward, payment or commendation.
Keep your good turns a secret.
2. Regardless of who you are, or what you have been, you can
create inside yourself a burning desire to be helpful to others.
You can develop your own Magnificent Obsession if you have
PMA.
3. When you share with others a part of what you have, that
which remains will multiply and grow. The more you share,
the more you will have. Therefore, share that which is good
and desirable, and withhold that which is bad and undesirable.
4. You can develop your own Magnificent Obsession by
becoming a part of a good cause, as did the mother who lost
her only child.
5. Character is the cornerstone in building and maintaining
success. But how can you improve your own character?
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude will help you find
the right answers.
6. There is something infinitely better than making a living: it is
making a noble life. Do you believe this? If you do, what will
you do about it?
7. A burning desire can generate the drive to action that is
imperative to great achievement. To develop a burning desire
to achieve a specific goal, daily keep the goal before you. And
strive to achieve it.
264
8. It takes courage and sacrifice to develop and maintain a
Magnificent Obsession. You may need to stand alone against
the ridicule and ignorance of others, as did Dr. Joseph Banks
Rhine.
9. Some people say money is the root of all evil. But the Bible
says: Love of money is the root of all evil. The good or evil of
money is contingent on a little difference. That little difference
is whether your attitude is positive or negative.
10. Men like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, Michael Benedum
used the power of their money to establish charitable,
educational, and religious Foundations. The good that has been
done by the Magnificent Obsessions of such men will live in
perpetuity!
11. Anything in life worth having is worth working for.
12. When you are asked to give money or time to a worthy cause,
repeat to yourself:
"What! Giving again?" I ask in dismay.
"And must I keep giving and giving away?"
"Oh no," said the angel looking me through,
"Just keep giving till the Master stops giving to you!"
THAT WHICH YOU SHARE WITH OTHERS
WILL MULTIPLY AND
THAT WHICH YOU WITHHOLD
WILL DIMINISH!

CHAPTER 16
How to Raise Your Energy Level
How is your energy level today? Did you wake up eager to face
the tasks ahead? Did you push your chair back from the breakfast
table with the feeling that you were rarin' to go? And did you
plunge into your work with enthusiasm?
You didn't? Perhaps for some time now you just haven't had the
vim and vigor you think you should have. Perhaps you feel tired
before the day begins, and drag through your work without joy.
If so, let's do something about it!
Vernon Wolfe, track coach, is an expert who can show us what to
do. He is one of the outstanding coaches in the country. Under his
tutelage, several high school students have broken national prep
school records.
How does he train these stars? Wolfe has a double prescription.
He teaches them to condition both their minds and their bodies
simultaneously.
"If you believe you can do it," says Vernon Wolfe, "most of the
time you can. It's mind over matter."
You have two types of energy. One is physical, the other is
mental and spiritual. The latter is by far the more important, for
from your subconscious mind you can draw vast power and
strength in time of need.
Think, for example, of the great feats of strength and endurance
you've read about people performing while under the stress of
intense emotion. There is an automobile accident and a husband
266
is pinned under the overturned car. In her moment of fear and
determination, his tiny and frail wife manages to raise the car
enough to free him! Or the insane person, his mind dominated by
his subconscious running wild, can break, lift, bend, and smash
with a force he never could hope for during periods of normality.
In a series of articles for Sports Illustrated, Dr. Roger Bannister
told how he first broke the four-minute mile on May 6, 1954, by
training both his mind and his muscles to accomplish this long-
sought dream of the athletic world. For months, he conditioned
his subconscious into the belief that the record, which some
people claimed was unattainable, could be achieved. Others
thought of the four-minute mark as a barrier. Bannister thought of
it as a gateway which, if he once passed through, would I open
the way to many new records for himself and other milers.
And of course he was right. Roger Bannister led the way. In a
period of little more than four years after he first set a four-
minute mile, the feat was performed 46 times by himself and
other runners! And in one race, at Dublin, Ireland, on August 6,
1958, five runners ran the mile in less than four minutes!
The man who taught Roger Bannister the secret was Dr. Thomas
Kirk Cureton, director of the physical fitness laboratory at the
University of Illinois. Dr. Cureton has developed revolutionary
ideas concerning the body's energy level. They apply, he says, to
both athletes and non-athletes. They can make a runner run faster
and the average man live longer.
"There is no reason why," Dr. Cureton says, "any man can't be as
fit at 50 as he was at 20 — providing he knows how to train his
body."
Dr. Cureton's system is based on two principles: (1) Train the
whole  body.   (2)  Push  yourself to  the  limit  of endurance,
extending the limit with each workout.
267
"The art of record-breaking," he says, "is the ability to take more
out of yourself than you've got. You punish yourself more and
more and rest between spells."
Dr. Cureton became acquainted with Roger Bannister while
running physical fitness tests on European athletic stars. He
noticed that Bannister's body was wonderfully developed in some
ways. For example, his heart was 25 percent larger than normal in
relation to his body size.
But, in other ways, Bannister wasn't as well developed as the
average man. Bannister took Cureton's advice to develop his
whole body. He learned to condition his mind by taking up
mountain climbing. This taught him how to overcome obstacles.
Equally important, he learned to break big goals down into little
ones. Roger Bannister reasoned that a man ran a single quarter-
mile faster than he ran the four quarters of a full mile. So he
trained himself to think of the four quarters in the mile separately.
In his training, he would dash a quarter mile, then jog a lap
around the track to rest Then he would dash another quarter mile.
Each time, he aimed to run the quarter in 58 seconds or less.
Fifty-eight times four equals 232 seconds, or three minutes and
52 seconds. He ran to the point of collapse. Then he would rest.
Each time, the point of collapse was pushed back a little. When
he finally ran his great race, it was in three minutes, 59.6
seconds!
Dr. Cureton taught Roger Bannister that "the more the body
endures, the more it will endure." Beliefs about "overtraining"
and "staleness," he says, are myths.
But he emphasizes that rest is as important as exercise activity.
The body needs to rebuild in even larger quantities what has been
torn down in exercise. That's how strength, vitality, energy are
developed. The body and mind both recharge themselves during
268
periods of rest and relaxation. If you don't give them a chance to
do so, severe damage — and even death — can result.
Is it time to recharge your battery? There's no glory in being the
richest man in the graveyard. You don't want to be the best
scientist, doctor, executive, salesman, or employee lying —
prematurely — under the most ornate headstone. A loved
mother, wife, father, son, or daughter can bring happiness. Why
then, bring grief, instead? Why be confined to a mental
sanitarium or lie embalmed six feet under a blanket of beautiful
green grass — simply because a needless drain damaged a battery
that wasn't recharged?
The small child doesn't know when he is excessively tired. But he
surely shows it in his behavior and actions. The adolescent may
realize he is over-fatigued, but refuse to admit it — even to
himself. Then sexual, family, scholastic, and social problems may
seem unsolvable and unbearable. They may motivate him to
temporary or permanent destructive acts — acts that injure
himself and others.
When your energy level is low, your health and your desirable
characteristics may be subdued by the negative. You, like a
storage battery, are dead when your energy level is zero. What is
the solution? Recharge your battery? How? Relax, play, rest, and
sleep!
How to tell when your battery needs recharging. Here is a
checklist to help you determine your present energy level. You
can use it whenever you feel that your energy level is slipping. If
you are a well-balanced person, your battery may need recharging
when you act and feel:
Unduly sleepy or tired
Tactless, unfriendly, suspicious
269
Querulous, insulting, hostile
Irritable, sarcastic, mean
Nervous, excitable, hysterical
Worrisome, fearful, jealous
Rash, ruthless, excessively selfish
Excessively emotional, depressed, or frustrated
PMA demands a good energy level — and vice versa! When
you are fatigued, your usually positive, desirable feelings,
emotions, thoughts, and actions have a tendency to turn negative.
When you are rested and in good health, the direction is changed
back to positive. Fatigue often brings out the worst within you.
When your battery is charged and your energy and activity level
is up to standard, you are at your best! That is when you think
and act with PMA!
If your feelings and actions indicate that your better qualities are
being subdued by those which are undesirable and negative, it's
time to recharge your battery!
Yes, to maintain your level of both physical and mental energy
you need to exercise both your body and mind. But there is a
third factor. Your body and mind both! need to be fed properly.
You help to maintain your physical body by taking in quantities
of wholesome, nutritious foods. You maintain your mental and
spiritual vigor by absorbing mental and spiritual vitamins from
inspirational and religious books.
Vitamins — necessary for a healthy mind and body! George
Scarseth, Ph.D., former Director of Research for the American
Farm Research Association in Lafayette, Indiana, told about a
village on the seacoast of Africa. The village is more advanced
than a community of similar tribes in the interior. Why? Because
its inhabitants are physically stronger and more mentally alert —
they have more bodily energy — than the ulterior tribesmen. The
270
difference between the tribesmen on the coast and those living
inland stems from a difference in diet. The village tribesmen in
the ulterior do not have a sufficient amount of protein whereas
those on the coast obtain quantities from the fish they eat.
In his book, Climate Makes the Man, Clarence Mills wrote that
the United States Government found some inhabitants of the
Isthmus of Panama excessively sluggish in their mental and
physical activity. A scientific study disclosed that both the plant
and animal life, on which they depended for food, lacked the B
vitamins. When thiamine was added to their diet, the same people
became more energetic and active.
If you suspect that your diet is deficient in certain vitamins and
elements so that your energy level is depressed, you should do
something about it. A good cookbook can help you, and there are
government pamphlets available at low cost If the condition
persists, have a physical checkup.
Like your body, your subconscious mind will accept and absorb
mental and spiritual vitamins without effort. But, unlike your
physical body, the subconscious will digest and retain unlimited
quantities. Unlike your stomach, it never becomes stuffed! It will
take and hold as much as you feed it — and still hold more!
Where will you find these mental and spiritual vitamins? In
books such as those recommended in Chapter 22, "The Amazing
Power of a Bibliography!"
In effect, the subconscious mind is like a battery. From it, you
can obtain tremendous surges of mental and spiritual energy
which often transmute themselves into physical vitality. These
jolts of energy will go to waste if we permit them to be short-
circuited by needless negative emotions. But used constructively,
271
this energy can multiply itself many times, just as a powerhouse
generator produces vast amounts of useful power.
The late William C. Lengel, who was a prominent editor-in-chief
in the book publishing business, illustrated this point beautifully
in an article for Success Unlimited magazine. Lengel described
how energy is wasted through needless "worry, hate, fear,
suspicion, anger and rage."
"All these waste elements," he said, "could just as easily be
transformed into power-producing units."
To illustrate his point, Mr. Lengel drew a picture of an electrical
power plant: "... the open mouths of the furnaces, the red flames
roaring inside, the water in the steam gauges bobbing at proper
temperature level, the steam driving the pistons turning the great
generators, the copper commutators — golden surfaces —
revolving so fast they seem motionless, green and blue sparks
flashing from under the brushes, thick cables hooked up to the
switchboard, carrying the electric current throughout a city for
thousands of useful purposes.
"Then the other side of the picture," Lengel continued. "Same
plant, same boilers, engines, generators. The only difference
being that the switchboard was dark and the heavy cables, instead
of being hooked up to the switch- board were stuck down into a
barrel of water while the workmen ran tests on the plant. All of
the power is, in effect, wasted. Not an elevator able to run, not a
machine able to operate, not a single bulb able to light."
And Lengel concluded that in the same way "a failure uses up as
much energy in his work at failing as a successful person uses in
winning success."
272
Tommy Bolt, the golf champion, used to waste his energy that
way. If he sliced a ball or missed the green, he would let go with
a fit of temper. Frequently, he'd be come so angry that he'd wrap
a golf club around the nearest tree.
When he read the famous prayer of St. Francis of Assisi, it
changed him into a man who directed his energy into the most
fruitful channels. The prayer Tommy new peace of mind and ever
since then he carried in his pocket a card imprinted with a portion
the prayer. It reads:
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the
wisdom to know the difference.
Man is the only member of the animal kingdom who, through the
functioning of his conscious mind, can voluntarily control his
emotions from within, rather than be forced to do so by external
influences. He alone can deliberately change habits of emotional
response. The more civilized, cultured, and refined you are, the
easier you can control your emotions and feelings — if you
choose to do so.
Fear, for example, is good under certain circumstances. If it were
not for fear of water, many children would drown. However, it is
entirely possible that you are wasting your mental and spiritual
energy in this or other misdirected emotions. If so, you can throw
a switch to direct the energy into useful channels. How? By
keeping your mind on the things you do want and off the things
you don't want. Your emotions are immediately subject to action.
Therefore, get into action. Substitute a positive feeling for the
negative one. For example, if you are fearful and want to be
courageous, act courageous!
273
If you want to be energetic, act energetic. But make sure, of
course, that your energy is expended to a good and useful
purpose.
Dawn Fraser of Australia gives us a wonderful case in point.
Born on the "wrong side of the tracks" in Bal-main, a waterside
suburb of Sydney, Dawn had an anemic body. But she had a
king-size determination to become a great swimming champion.
She became the world's fastest woman swimmer. She was good.
But sometimes she wasn't quite good enough to satisfy herself.
While flying home from the Cardiff Empire Games, she read a
book. It was Think and Grow Rich. "I found Napoleon Hill's
formulas for success most inspiring," she says. "I began thinking
about our defeat by the English girls in the medley relay when, in
the freestyle leg, I swam 60.6 seconds. That was six-tenths of a
second faster than my own world record, but still not good
enough to give us the 12-yard start we needed.
"I wondered whether I had given everything in me on that final
lap."
Dawn Fraser began thinking about the dream she'd had for so
long — to become the first woman to swim 100 meters in less
than 60 seconds. "The Magic Minute," she called it.
"If I could have made that final leg in the magic minute, we
might have won," she thought.
"From that moment the old hope of cracking the minute became a
burning desire with me. Call it a controlled obsession if you like.
I made it my major ambition and formed a plan of positive action
with the magic minute as my goal. As Mr. Hill advises, I decided
to go the extra mile — mentally as well as physically."
274
In addition to training her body, Miss Fraser now conditions her
mind as well. Although she has yet to achieve her "Magic
Minute" as of this writing, she has cracked record after record.
Athletic coaches throughout Australia have been attracted to
study Napoleon Hill's teachings, according to Thomas H.
Wyngard, an Australian newspaperman.
"Top coaches, in their search for methods that will give their
champions just that little bit extra over and above their regular
scientifically devised training program, are finding new
inspiration in the doctrines of the great American expert,"
Wyngard says.
"They are adapting Napoleon Hill's technique of mental approach
to what is, essentially, a physical problem. Some have taken the
PMA Science of Success course so they may apply the principles
correctly."
Is it time for you to recharge your battery? Have yon now begun
to apply the principles presented in Success Through a Positive
Mental Attitude? Are you ready to become a champion? If so,
you will want to learn how you can enjoy good health and live
longer — the subject of our next chapter.
PILOT NO. 16
Thoughts to Steer By
1. How is your energy level at this moment?
2. What is your most important source of physical, mental, and
spiritual energy?
275
3. How can you apply the principles Dr. Thomas Kirk Cureton
taught to Roger Bannister so that you'll have extra energy to
achieve your own goals?
4. Do you push to the limit of your endurance-then rest and try
again?
5. Is it time to recharge your battery?
6. How can you avoid or neutralize fatigue?
7. Are most of your meals based on well-balanced diets?
8. Do you take spiritual and mental vitamins daily by reading
inspirational material or listening to inspirational tapes or
records?
9. Is your energy being directed toward useful channels? Or is it
being short-circuited and wasted?
10. "A failure uses up as much energy in his work at failing as a
successful person uses in winning success."
11. "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the
wisdom to know the difference."
12. When is the emotion of fear justified? Unjustified?
13. To be energetic, act energetically!

CHAPTER 17
You Can Enjoy Good
Health and Live Longer
Positive Mental Attitude plays an important role in your health
and your day-to-day energies and enthusiasms for your life and
your work. "Every day in every way, through the grace of God, I
am getting better and better," is no pie-in-the-sky jargon for the
man who recites the sentence several times each day upon
awakening and again before going to bed.
In one sense, he is putting PMA forces to work for him. He is
using the forces which attract the better things of life to him. He
is using the forces which the authors of Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude want you to use.
How PMA aids you. PMA will help you develop mental and
physical health and a longer life. And NMA will just as surely
undermine mental and physical health and shorten your life. It all
depends upon which side of the talisman you turn up. Positive
Mental Attitude properly employed has saved the lives of many
persons because someone close to them had a strong Positive
Mental Attitude. The following incident proves the point.
The baby was only two days old when the doctor said, "The child
won't live."
"The child will live!" responded the father. The father had a
Positive Mental Attitude — he had faith — he believed in the
miracle of prayer. He prayed. He also believed in action. And he
got into action! He placed the child under the care of a
pediatrician who also had a Positive Mental Attitude — a doctor
who knew from experience that for every physical weakness
Nature provides a compensating factor. The child did live!
277
I CANT GO ON!
DEATH SEPARATES PAIR — FOR INSTANT
The above headline appeared in the Chicago Daily News. The
article mentioned that a building engineer — a sixty-two-year-old
man — came home and went to bed with chest pains and
shortness of breath. His wife, who was ten years younger, became
alarmed and began hopefully to rub her husband's arms to
increase circulation. But he died.
"I can't stand to go on any more," the widow told her mother,
who was beside her.
And then the widow died. She died that very same day!
The baby that lived and the widow who died demonstrate the
powerful forces of positive and negative mental attitudes.
Knowing that accentuating the positive will attract good things to
you and accepting the negative will bring the bad, isn't it common
sense to develop positive thoughts and attitudes?
If you have not already done so, now is the time to develop a
PMA philosophy. Prepare for any possible emergency. Always
have something to live for. And remember, when you have
something to live for, the subconscious mind forces upon your
conscious mind strong motivating factors to keep you alive in
times of emergency. We need look no further than Rafael Correa
to prove our point.
An eventful night. He was only twenty years of age. His family
was not wealthy, yet it was particularly well esteemed. Therefore,
six doctors and a young intern had struggled all night in that
small operating room at San Juan, Puerto Rico, trying to save
Rafael's life. Now, after twelve hours of unceasing watchfulness
and attention, they were tired. And they were sleepy. Try as they
278
would, they were finally unable to hear his heart beat. They
couldn't find his pulse.
The head surgeon took a knife and cut the blood vessels in
Rafael's wrist. The fluid was yellow. The surgeon hadn't used an
anesthetic — for the boy's body was so weak that pain didn't
seem possible. The doctors thought he could not hear what they
were saying. And they spoke as if he were dead. One said, "Not
even a miracle can save him now!"
The chief surgeon took off his surgical coat and prepared to leave
the room. The young intern asked, "May I have the body?" "Yes,"
was the response. The doctors left the room.
It has been written: So we do not lose heart... Because we look
not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen;
for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are
unseen are eternal.
They could see the physical body, but Rafael was a mind with a
body. What was happening to the mind of Rafael Correa which
was not visible?
In that twilight state between life and death, Rafael was not able
consciously to move his body. But because of the positive mental
attitude he had developed in his subconscious mind by reading
inspirational books, his mind was communicating with a Higher
Power. He felt that God was with him.
He began to speak to God as a friend — like a man talking with
another. "You know me — You are inside me — You are my
blood — You are my life — You are my everything. There is but
one mind — one principle — one substance in the universe, and I
am one with all else.
279
"If I die, I don't lose anything. I just change form. But I am only
twenty years old. Dear God, I'm not afraid to die — but I'm
willing to live! If You choose to give me life, some day,
somehow, I'll be able and willing through Your mercy to lead a
better life and to help others."
As the intern approached Rafael, he looked at Rafael's face and
observed the twitching of his eyelids and a teardrop falling from
the corner of his left eye. "Doctor, doctor, come quickly! I think
he's alive!" he called excitedly.
It took more than a year for him to regain his strength, But Rafael
Correa did live!
Some years later Rafael flew from San Juan to Chicago to ask the
authors to hold a three-evening PMA seminar at San Juan. It was
then that Rafael told us his story of that eventful night in his life.
We were inspired by his story and particularly also by the fact
that since he had been granted his life, he was trying to make
good on his promise to help others. We flew to San Juan to
conduct the seminar.
While we were in San Juan, Rafael introduced us to the chief
surgeon who had been with him all that night, and the doctor
confirmed Rafael's story. During the course of the conversation
we asked Rafael, "What was the name of the book that influenced
you in your hour of need?" Rafael replied:
"I had read many inspirational books, but I believe the thoughts
that went through my mind that night were primarily from
Science and Health, With Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker
Eddy."
280
As proved by Rafael, inspirational books are tremendously
instrumental in changing lives. And there is no book with more
inspiration and motivation than the Bible. The Bible has changed
the lives of more persons than any other book. It has helped
countless thousands to develop physical, mental, and moral
health. Reading the Bible has developed a greater understanding
of Its truths in many persons and caused them to draw closer to
their own church. This is because the Bible has motivated them to
positive action.
An inspirational book like the one you are now reading can also
motivate you. It can be the catalyst which starts you on the road
to desirable, positive action and success.
Use a book as a catalyst. The dictionary defines a catalyst in
physical chemistry as a substance that causes or accelerates a
chemical reaction. The dictionary further states that an anti-
catalyst, or negative catalyst, retards a reaction.
The authors recommend that you use good inspirational books as
positive catalysts to accelerate your progress toward achievement
of true success in life. And they hasten to warn that you choose
such catalysts with care. In Chapter 22 of this book, entitled "The
Amazing Power of a Bibliography," you will find listed many
books which the authors guarantee can act as positive catalysts in
your life — if you are ready.
Martin J. Kohe in his book Your Greatest Power tells of a British
regiment that used the 91st Psalm as a catalyst to aid them not
just to achieve a material goal, but for the very preservation of
life itself.
Kohe wrote: "F. L. Rawson, noted engineer and one of England's
greatest scientists, in his book, Life Understood, gives an account
of a British regiment under control of Colonel Whitlesey, which
281
served in the World War for more than four years without losing
a man. This unparalleled record was made possible by means of
active cooperation of officers and men in memorizing and
repeating regularly the words of the 91st Psalm, which has been
called the Psalm of Protection."
Protection of your life can also be accomplished by protecting
your health. And, let there be no misunderstanding about it! Your
health is one of your most valuable assets. Many a man today
would be more than willing to trade his wealth for good health.
"I'd rather have my health than his money!" It is said that a
healthy, ambitious eighteen-year-old clerk in a produce firm in
Cleveland, Ohio, developed a major definite aim of becoming the
world's richest man. At the age of fifty-seven he retired on
doctor's orders. Like many American businessmen, he had it —
stomach ulcers and shot nerves! In addition, he was a hated man.
"I'd rather have my health than his money," many said. John K.
Winkler tells the story in John D., a Portrait in Oils.
Can money buy physical and mental health, a longer life —
and the esteem of your fellowmen? When John D. Rockefeller
retired from active business, his major definite aims were to
develop a healthy body, maintain a healthy mind, live a long life
and later, to win the esteem of his fellowmen. Could money buy
these? It did! Here's how Rockefeller did it and what it can mean
to you: Rockefeller:
• Attended the Baptist Church sendees every Sunday and took
notes to learn the principles that he might apply daily.
• Slept eight hours every night and took short naps every day.
And through rest he avoided harmful fatigue.
282
• Took a bath or shower every day. He was neat and clean in
his appearance.
• Moved to Florida to a climate conducive to his good health
and longevity.
• Lived a well-balanced life. For fresh air and sunshine were
absorbed while he daily engaged in his favorite outdoor
sport — g°lf- And indoor games, reading, and other
wholesome activities were enjoyed with regularity.
• Ate slowly, in moderation, and chewed everything well. The
saliva in his mouth was permitted to mix with the masticated
foods and liquids. And they were well digested before they
were swallowed. They were swallowed at body temperature.
Foods too hot or too cold for the mouth were not dumped
into his stomach to burn or freeze its lining.
• Digested mental and spiritual vitamins. For grace was said at
each meal. And at dinner, it was his custom to have his
secretary, a guest, or a member of his family read the Bible, a
sermon, an inspirational poem, a motivating article from a
news paper, magazine or book.
• Employed Dr. Hamilton Fisk Biggar full time. Dr. Biggar
was paid to keep John D. well, happy, and alive. He did this
through motivating his patient to develop a cheerful, happy
attitude. And Rockefeller lived to be ninety-seven.
• Didn't want the hatred of his fellowmen to be inherited by
the members of his family. Therefore, he began intelligently
to share a part of his possessions with the needy.
• At first Rockefeller's motive was primarily a selfish one. He
wanted a good reputation. Then something happened! By
acting  generous,   he   became  generous.   And  by  bringing
283
happiness and health to many through his charitable and
philanthropic contributions, he found them for himself.
• And the Foundations he established will benefit mankind for
generations to come. His life and money were instruments
for good. This world is a better and healthier world to live in
because of John D. Rockefeller!
You shouldn't have to amass a fortune before you come to realize
that PMA will attract perfect health. But there are some other
ingredients which should be used along with PMA and one of
them is health education. Don't be ignorant about your health.
The price of ignorance is sin, sickness and death! What do you
know about Hygiene? Hygiene is defined as "a system of
principles or rules designed for the promotion of health." Social
Hygiene often refers specifically to venereal contagion. Ignorance
of physical, mental, and social hygiene can lead to sin, sickness,
and death.
If you are timid in discussing such matters, read Venture of Faith
by Mary Alice and Harold Blake Walker. Today, because of
PMA, the family, schools, churches, press, the medical
profession, federal and state governments, and youth
organizations endeavor to lift the dark cloud of ignorance
regarding physical, mental, and social hygiene through education.
Prevention is taught as well as cure.
But a cure for alcoholism is not so easy to come by as education
in hygiene. Alcoholism ranks as the fourth largest health problem
in the nation. It follows mental and moral disease and is one of
the greatest contributors to those two diseases. The economic cost
of alcoholism is 25 billion dollars per year. The greater portion of
this is loss of time to industry, followed by hospital costs and
physical damages — caused mainly by automobile accidents. But
284
the money loss is negligible compared to the loss of physical,
mental, and moral health, and the loss of life attributable to
alcoholism.
An alcoholic has a mental illness which lies dormant until his
first drink. If he doesn't start the habit, liquor doesn't have the
power of attraction for him. If he drinks, the affinity is strong,
and he will drink to excess. If he drinks to excess, the attraction
may become irresistible, or seem so. And when he tries to resist
and doesn't succeed, he may believe he cannot be cured.
What happens to excessive drinkers? Alcohol is known to alter
the brain waves as recorded by the scientific instrument known as
an electroencephalograph. It has a most potent influence on nerve
cell metabolism which results in slow rhythms and eventual
suppression of voltage and brings about a change in the level of
consciousness.
A human body is alive only as long as its subconscious mind
functions. It can be kept alive for a long time without the
functioning of the conscious mind. There are degrees of
consciousness.
Sanity is that healthy state of mind when the activities of the
conscious and the subconscious are in proper balance. And while
they work together, each has its specific duties; each has
inhibiting factors. While sometimes it is healthful and wholesome
for a person to do the things he wants to do but which are
forbidden, judgments and actions should be the result of the
conscious and subconscious working in balance.
The intellect and other powers of the conscious mind act as a
governor regulating the subconscious when a person is in a
conscious state of activity. As the activity of this governor slows
down, the machine begins to run wild, and the individual may act
285
in an illogical manner. His uncontrolled activities may range from
a simple foolish act to a state of mind commonly known as
insanity.
As the inhibiting barriers are lowered, due to the effect of alcohol
on the brain cells, the restraining controls of the conscious mind
become less effective. When the emotions, passions, and other
activities of the subconscious mind have too free a rein, without
proper regulation by the balance wheel of the intellect, the
individual in this semi-conscious state of mind will commit
foolish and undesirable acts due to alcoholic influence.
Alcoholism is indeed a dread disease. If allowed to control a
person's life, it can render that person physically, mentally, and
morally ill and send him to a living hell. Once alcohol has gained
control in a person's life, it does not readily relinquish its hold.
But there is a cure!
There's always a cure! What's the cure? Stop drinking! For the
alcoholic, this is more easily said than done. The important thing
it that it can be done. He can do it!
When you develop a positive mental attitude, you don't give up
trying because you have previously failed or because you know
of cases where others have failed. You can be motivated and
receive hope from successful experiences. A baby learning to
walk isn't criticized for falling after taking the first three steps. It
is given credit for the progress it makes in response to its
conscious effort.
The alcoholic may find help in a number of places. Complete
cures for alcoholism have been effected by environmental
influences in the religious therapy of established churches; rescue
missions like the Pacific Garden Mission in Chicago; revival
286
meetings of evangelists like Oral Roberts; Alcoholics
Anonymous; medical and psychiatric help including hypnosis;
private hospitals such as the Keeley Institute at Dwight, Illinois;
or an inspirational book like / Dare You!
However, each individual must win his own internal victory. But,
generally, it is necessary for him to come under the environ-
mental influence of someone who will help him through
suggestion until he takes control of his own power. Or, if you
will, until he has a positive mental attitude developed beyond the
point of relapsing into a negative mental attitude. PMA can do
wonders for the alcoholic if only he will put it to work for him.
And PMA will work wonders for you, too, in attracting health
and longevity.
Uncertainty about your health can undermine your PMA: by
causing you to worry about every little ache or pain. The longer
you remain uncertain, the more your attitude changes direction
from positive to negative. And if the symptoms you have noticed
really do denote a condition that requires attention, the longer you
remain uncertain and do nothing, the greater are the opportunities
for that condition to develop. Don't be uncertain about your
health. Get into action!
Take the guesswork out of your health! He was a young,
dynamic, successful automobile sales manager. His whole future
was ahead of him, yet he was mighty low! In fact, he expected to
die! He even selected and purchased his cemetery lot and made
all arrangements for his burial. He got his house in order. But
here's what actually happened.
At times he became short of breath. His heart beat rapidly. His
throat choked up. Eventually he went to his family doctor, who
was a very successful physician and surgeon. The doctor advised
287
him to take a rest, to take life easy, to retire from the work he
loved, the thrilling game of selling automobiles.
The sales manager stayed home for a while and rested his body,
but because of fears, his mind was not at ease. He still became
short of breath. His heart would beat rapidly. His throat would
choke up. It was summer-time, and his doctor advised him to
vacation in Colorado.
He was carried into the Pullman compartment. Colorado, with its
healthful climate, inspirational mountains, did not prevent the
manifestation of his fears. He would frequently experience
shortness of breath, rapid beating of the heart, and the same
choked-up feeling. Within a week he returned home. He believed
death was coming.
"Take the guesswork out of it!" this salesman was told (as you
might be told) by one of the authors. "You have everything to
gain and nothing to lose by going to a clinic such as Mayo
Brothers at Rochester, Minnesota. Do It Now!" At his request he
was driven to Rochester by a relative. He was actually afraid that
he might die en route.
When the sales manager went through the clinic, he was told
what was wrong with him. The doctor said, "Your difficulty is
that you breathe in too much oxygen." He laughed and said,
"That's silly!" The doctor responded, "Jump up and down fifty
times as if you were jumping rope." He became short of breath;
his heart beat rapidly; and his throat choked up.
"What can I do about it?" the young man asked. The doctor
responded, "When you feel this condition coming on, you can:
(1) breathe into a paper bag, or (2) just hold your breath for a
little while," and the doctor banded the patient a paper bag. The
patient followed instructions. His heart stopped beating rapidly,
288
breathing became normal, and his throat didn't bother him. He
left the clinic a happy man.
Whenever the symptoms of his illness occurred, he would just
hold his breath for a short time, and his body would function
normally. After a few months he lost his fears, and his symptoms
disappeared. This happened more than 30 years ago. He hasn't
required medical attention since.
Of course, not all cures are so easily effected. There are times
when you may have to use all your resources before aid is found.
However, it is wise to continue the search with persistence and a
positive mental attitude. Such determination and optimism
usually pay off. It did for another sales manager. Let us tell you
about him.
There is always a cure — find it. This particular sales manager
registered in a small town hotel and fell and broke a leg as he
entered the room assigned to him. The hotel manager took our
sales manager to the nearest hospital where an attending
physician set his leg. A few days later it was considered safe for
him to be moved, and he returned to his home.
He convalesced for several weeks under the attention of his
family physician. But while he seemed to improve, the fracture
did not heal. After many weeks, the doctor told him that he would
get progressively worse: he would become a cripple. This sales
manager was very much disturbed because his work required that
he be on his feet.
He discussed the matter with one of the authors who said, "Don't
believe it! There is always a cure — find it! Take the guesswork
out of it. Do It Now!" He was told the story of the automobile
sales manager as it has been told to you, and it was suggested that
he make arrangements to go to Mayo Brothers Clinic.
289
He also left the clinic a happy man. Why? He was told, "Your
system needs calcium. We could load you with it, but the calcium
would wear off. Just drink a quart of milk a day." He did. In time
the injured leg became as strong as the sound one.
A positive mental attitude applied to health takes into
consideration the possibility of accidents. In fact, Safety first is a
PMA symbol. From it you receive the suggestion to become alert
and enforce your desire to live — to save life and property.
Be sure you're not driving to your own funeral. A newspaper
article carried a headline reading: "Late for a Funeral, Six Die in
105 MPH Blowout" The lead read:
Six funerals were precipitated Sunday by the crash of an
automobile whose driver was stepping on the gas in fear
he and his relatives would be late for one funeral.
Drive carefully if you want to be physically and mentally healthy,
and if you want to live longer. As a pedestrian, be alerted to the
hazards and obey traffic laws. And when you ride with another
person at the wheel of the automobile, remember you are at the
mercy of his physical and mental weaknesses, if any, as well as
the mechanical condition of his car. Have the courage to refuse to
ride with an intoxicated driver, or in an automobile in which the
brakes don't operate properly — even if you own the car. "The
life you save may be your own!"
Safety first saves lives with PMA. Although it cost one million
dollars a floor for each of its forty-one stories, the Prudential
Building in Chicago was the most inexpensive office building of
its kind ever constructed. Why?
It didn't cost a single life! There were no serious accidents. Safety
factors were installed because of PMA.
290
In comparison, negative mental attitudes comprising ignorance
and carelessness, caused in tragic accidents:
One death for every one hundred feet of height of the
Empire State Building!
One hundred and ten deaths in the construction of
Hoover Dam!
One life for every one hundred and ten feet in the
construction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge!
Eighty deaths in the construction of the Colorado River
Aqueduct!
One thousand two hundred and nineteen deaths in the
construction of the Panama Canal! (There were four
thousand seven hundred sixty-six additional fatalities
during   the   construction   of   this   project   from   other
causes.)
Ninety-seven deaths in the building of Grand Coulee
Dam and the Columbia River Basin Project!
Of course, no one actually knows when tragedy will strike. But it
always is better to be prepared. You will be prepared if you have
a positive mental attitude. Aunt Kitty was.
When tragedy strikes! Aunt Kitty lost her only son when he was
nine years old. Like many good housewives and mothers, she had
no business training. But Aunt Kitty did have a strong religious
faith. She knew that in spite of her great loss, it was her job to go
on living and contributing her share to make this world a better
world to live in. But how could she maintain physical and mental
health so that she could go on?
291
Aunt Kitty decided that in order to ease her pain and fill the great
void in her life she would have to: keep very busy and do
whatever her abilities would permit to make other people happy,
since she could no longer do this for her son.
So she got a job as a waitress in a busy restaurant. Her hours were
long. Her work made it mandatory to talk with people and to act
cheerful. Faith in her religion and a sincere interest in other
people, combined with work and time, neutralized her pain and
saved her physical and mental health.
Actually, your health may be affected by many internal
influences. And some of these influences may be mental figments
of the imagination.
High school girl gets pains before examinations! Because of
the inter-relationship between the mind and body, the
subconscious mind may create apparent bodily disorders induced
by emotional disturbances to bring about a specific desired result.
A true life experience will prove the point.
A high school girl experienced severe backaches the morning of
any day on which she was to take a German or history
examination. She didn't like either subject. She wasn't properly
prepared. Her pains were so severe that she believed she couldn't
get up from bed. She was not pretending. She suffered.
A peculiar characteristic of the pain was that about 3:30 in the
afternoon, when school was over for the day, the pain would
subside. On the same evening when her boyfriend came to call,
the pain would marvelously disappear!
This girl, you probably are thinking, could do with a little
psychiatry. She could. She and many others like her have been
292
helped through religion and psychiatry. The two are not as far
apart as many may think. Why?
Religion and psychiatry. Rules and regulations for physical and
mental health and a longer life were woven into religion long
before words similar to physiology, psychology, and psychiatry
became part of any language. This is especially true regarding the
application of techniques affecting the subconscious mind.
It is easy to see why psychiatric clinics and counseling services
are becoming an integral part of church organizations regardless
of their religious denominations.
The minister to millions helps the sick! The Rev. Norman
Vincent Peale and Smiley Blanton, M.D., established The
American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry, which is now
known as the Institutes of Religion and Health. It is a nonprofit,
nonsectarian clinic in New York City. Anyone with an emotional
problem is eligible for help regardless of race, religion, or ability
to pay. Today there is a full and part time professional staff of
thirtyfive composed of psychiatrists, ministers, psychologists, and
psychiatric social workers.
If you would like information on how to establish a counseling
service in your church, write the Institutes.
What lies ahead? Mental and physical health are two great
rewards of a positive mental attitude. It is true: a positive mental
attitude takes effort, patience, and practice to gain and maintain.
But a definite purpose, clean and clear thinking, creative vision,
courageous action, persistence and true perception, all applied
with enthusiasm and faith will go far to help you achieve and
maintain a positive mental attitude.
And what lies ahead as you approach your definite goals?
293
Happiness lies ahead.
If you are happy now, you will wish to maintain and increase this
wonderful happiness which you already have. If you are not
happy now, you will want to learn how you can be happy. Let's
turn to Chapter 18, entitled "How To Be Happy" to find
additional PMA success principles to speed us in our pursuit of
happiness.
PILOT NO. 17
Thoughts to Steer By
1. You can have more perfect health. A positive mental attitude
affects your health. It attracts good health to you. A negative
mental attitude attracts ill health.
2. Thinking good thoughts, positive and cheerful thoughts, will
improve the way you feel. What affects your mind also affects
your body.
3. A positive mental attitude toward the ones you love may be the
means of saving their lives. Remember the father who saved
the life of his infant son by going into action with a positive
mental attitude.
4. Learn to practice PMA instead of giving in to NMA as the
engineer's wife did. Her NMA allowed death to claim her.
5. Develop within you a positive mental attitude so powerful that
it seeps down from your conscious into your subconscious
mind. If you do, you will find that in times of need and emer-
gency, it will automatically flash back to your conscious mind.
Even in the greatest emergency of life: death.
6. Make a study of the Bible and other inspirational books. They
will both inspire and teach you how to motivate yourself to
294
positive desirable action and thus help you achieve the goals
you desire.
7. Learn to use the 17 success principles and to apply them to
your life. Have you memorized them?
8. All the wealth in the world cannot, by itself, buy good health.
But you can achieve good health by striving for it and
observing simple rules of hygiene and good health habits.
Remember, John D. Rockefeller had to retire at the age of 57
because of ill health, but through a positive mental attitude
and wholesome living, he reached the ripe old age of 97.
9. PMA recognizes the importance of education in physical,
mental, and social hygiene, and that ignorance of these
subjects can mean sin, sickness, and death. Keep abreast of
current developments affecting your mental, moral, and
physical health.
10. Never abandon hope —for there is a potential cure for every
ailment. Develop PMA and take the guesswork out of your
health by seeking aid at the right time.
11. PMA repels accidents and tragedies by keeping the person
with PMA alert to dangers at all times. Should tragedy strike,
however, PMA can guide you in meeting reverses calmly and
deliberately.
12. A sound mind and sound body are attainable if you will put
PMA to work for you. Remember — you can enjoy good
health and live longer with PMA.
I FEEL HEALTHY!
I FEEL HAPPY!
I FEEL TERRIFIC!

CHAPTER 18
Can You Attract Happiness?
Can you attract happiness?
Abraham Lincoln once made the remark, "It has been my
observation that people are just about as happy as they make up
their minds to be."
There is very little difference in people, but that little difference
makes a big difference I The little difference is attitude. The big
difference is whether it is positive or negative.
Persons who want to be happy will adopt a positive mental
attitude and be influenced by the PMA side of their talisman.
Thus happiness will be attracted to them. And those who turn on
NMA make a business of being unhappy. They don't attract —
they repel happiness.
"I want to be happy... " A popular song starts off with words
that contain a great deal of truth: "I want to be happy, but I won't
be happy, 'til I make you happy, too!"
One of the surest ways to find happiness for yourself is to devote
your energies toward making someone else happy. Happiness is
an elusive, transitory thing. And if you set out to search for it,
you will find it evasive. But if you try to bring happiness to
someone else, then it comes to you.
Writer Claire Jones, wife of a professor in the religion department
at Oklahoma City University, tells of a happiness they
experienced during their early married life. "We lived in a small
town the first two years we were married," she recalls, "and our
neighbors were a very old couple, the wife nearly blind and
296
confined to a wheelchair. The old man, not very well himself,
kept house and cared for her.
"My husband and I were decorating our Christmas tree a few
days before Christmas, when we decided on impulse to fix a tree
for the old people. We bought a small one, decorated it with tinsel
and lights, wrapped a few small gifts, and took it over the night
before Christmas.
"The old lady cried as she gazed dimly at the sparkling lights. Her
husband said over and over, 'But it's been years since we had a
tree.' They mentioned that tree nearly every time we visited them
during the next year.
"The next Christmas they were both gone from the little house. It
was a small thing we had done for them. But we were happy that
we'd done it."
Now the happiness they experienced as a result of their kindness
was a very deep, warm feeling the memory of which will remain
with them. It was a very special kind of happiness that comes to
those who do kind deeds.
But the kind of happiness which is most common and most
constant comes closer to being a state of contentment: a state of
being neither happy nor unhappy.
You are a happy person during a period when you predominantly
experience that positive state of mind in which you are happy
combined with that neutral state of mind in which you are not
unhappy.
And you can be happy, content, or unhappy. For the choice is
yours. The determining factor is whether you are under the
influence of a positive or negative mental attitude. And that factor
you can control.
297
Handicaps are no barrier to happiness. Surely if ever there was
a person who might have been expected to complain of
unhappiness Helen Keller was that person. Born deaf, mute, and
blind, deprived of knowledge of normal communication with the
persons who surrounded her, she had only her sense of touch to
help her to reach out to others and to experience the happiness of
loving and being loved.
But reach out she did, and through the aid of a devoted and
brilliant teacher who in love reached out to Helen Keller, that
deaf, mute, and blind little girl became a brilliant, joyful, happy
woman. Miss Keller once wrote:
Anyone who out of the goodness of his heart speaks a
helpful word, gives a cheering smile, or smooths over a
rough place in another's path knows that the delight he
feels is so intimate a part of himself that he lives by it The
joy of surmounting obstacles which once seemed
unremovable, and pushing the frontier of
accomplishment further — what joy is there like unto it?
If those who seek happiness would stop one little minute
and think, they would see that the delights they already
experience are as countless as the grasses at their feet, or
the dewdrops sparkling upon the morning flowers.
Helen Keller counted her blessings and was profoundly grateful
for them. Then she shared the wonder of these blessings with
others, and caused them to feel delight Because she shared that
which is good and desirable, she attracted unto herself more of
that which is good and desirable. For the more you share, the
more you will have. And if you share happiness with others,
happiness will grow richer within you.
298
But if you share misery and unhappiness, you will attract misery
and unhappiness to yourself. And we all know of persons who are
eternally having troubles — not problems, or opportunities in
disguise. Theirs are spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. No matter what happens
to them, it just isn't good. And this is because they are always
sharing their troubles with others.
Now there are many lonely people in this world who long for
love and friendship but never seem to get it Some repel that
which they seek with NMA. Others curl up in their little corners
and never venture out. They secretly hope that something good
will come to them, but they do not share any of the good which
they enjoy. They do not realize that when you withhold from
others that which you have which is good and desirable, your
own portion of the good and desirable diminishes.
Others, however, have the courage to do something about their
loneliness, and they find their answer in sharing the good and
beautiful with others. There was one such little boy who was a
very lonely, unhappy little boy indeed. When he was born his
backbone was arched into a grotesque hump and his left leg was
crooked. Looking at the infant, the doctor assured the boy's
father: "But he'll get along all right."
The family was poor. And the baby's mother died before he was a
year old. As he grew up, other children shunned him because of
his misshapen body and his inability to participate successfully in
many of their activities. Charles Steinmetz was his name. And he
was a lonely, unhappy little fellow.
But the Great Giver of All Good had not overlooked this little
fellow. To compensate for his misshapen body, Charles had been
endowed with an extraordinarily keen mind. Using the greatest
asset available to him, Charles ignored his physical disabilities
about which he felt he could do nothing, and worked to excel
299
with his mind. At five he could conjugate Latin verbs. At seven
he learned Greek and a smattering of Hebrew. At eight he had a
good understanding of algebra and geometry.
When he went on to college, he excelled in all his studies. In fact,
he was graduated with honors. He had carefully saved his pennies
so he could rent a dress suit for the occasion. But with the
inconsiderate cruelty that is so often characteristic of persons
under the influence of NMA, the school authorities posted a
notice on the bulletin board excusing Charles from the
ceremonies.
At long last it occurred to Charles that instead of trying to force
respect for himself from people by making them take notice of
his mental capacities, he would cultivate their friendship; he
would use his abilities not to attract notice and to satisfy his own
ego, but for the furtherance of the good of mankind. To start his
new way of life, he boarded a ship and came to America.
Having reached this country, Charles Steinmetz began to look for
a job. Several times he was rebuffed because of his appearance,
but he finally landed a job with General Electric as a draftsman at
$12 a week. In addition to his regular duties he spent long hours
in electrical research, and he endeavored to cultivate the
friendship of his fellow employees by trying to share with them
that which he had that was good and desirable.
After some time the chairman of the board of General Electric
Company recognized the rare genius of this man, and said to
Charles: "Here is our entire plant. Do anything you want with it.
Dream all day, if you wish. We'll pay you for dreaming."
Charles worked hard, long and earnestly. During Ms lifetime he
patented more than 200 electrical inventions and wrote many
books   and   papers   on   problems   of   electrical   theory   and
300
engineering. He knew the satisfaction of a job well done. And he
also knew the satisfaction of making contributions which went far
to make this world a better place to live in. He accumulated
wealth and acquired a lovely home which he shared with a young
couple he knew. Thus, Steinmetz experienced the happiness of a
full and useful life.
Happiness begins at home. The greater part of the life of each
of us is spent in our homes, with our families. And unfortunately
that dwelling which should be a haven of love, happiness, and
security too often turns into an antagonistic place where the
members do not enjoy happy and harmonious relationships.
Problems in the home can arise for many reasons.
In one of our PMA Science of Success classes a very gifted,
aggressive young man of about twenty-four was asked, "Have
you a problem?"
"Yes!" he replied, "My mother. In fact, I have decided to leave
home this weekend."
When the student was asked to discuss his problem, it became
evident that the relationship between him and his mother was not
harmonious. It was apparent to the instructor that her aggressive,
dominant personality was similar to his.
The class was informed that the personality of an individual can
be compared to the powers of a magnet. When two like powers
are in line and push or pull in the same direction, they are drawn
to each other by attraction. When the powers are opposed to each
other, they resist and repel one another.
When they are placed side by side and both confront the same
outside forces, the individuals like the magnets remain separate
301
entities. Yet their strength to attract and repel these forces is
increased even though between themselves they are opposed.
The instructor continued by saying, "It appears that your behavior
and that of your mother are so similar that you can determine how
she reacts to you by the way you react to her. You can probably
evaluate her feelings by analyzing your own. Therefore, you can
solve your problem easily!
"When two forceful personalities are opposed and it is desirable
that they live together in harmony, at least one must use the
power ofPMA.
"Here's your specific assignment for this week: When your
mother asks you to do something, do it cheerfully. When she
expresses an opinion, agree with her in a pleasant, sincere
manner, or don't say anything. When you are tempted to find fault
with her, find something good to say. You will have a most
pleasant experience. She will probably follow your example."
"It won't work!" responded the student. "She is just too hard to
get along with!"
"You're absolutely right," responded the instructor. "It won't work
unless — you try to work it with a positive mental attitude."
A week later the young man was asked how he was coming along
with his problem. His response was: "I am happy to say that there
hasn't been one unpleasant word between us all week. You might
be interested in knowing that I have decided to stay at home."
When parents don't understand their children. There is a
tendency for a person to assume that everyone always likes what
he likes and always thinks the way he thinks. For people have a
tendency to judge the reactions of others by their own reactions.
302
Now, like the young man who had a problem with his mother,
such a conclusion would at times be correct. But many parents
often have problems with their children because they fail to
realize that the personality of the child is different from theirs. It
is a mistake for parents not to realize that time changes both the
child and them. For they don't adjust their mental attitudes to
compensate for the changes within the child and themselves.
"I don't understand her!" the father said. A lawyer and his
wife had five wonderful children. The parents were unhappy
because their oldest daughter, who was a freshman at high school,
didn't respond to her parents the way they expected. The daughter
was unhappy, too.
"She's a good girl, but I don't understand her," the house; yet
she'll toil for hours at the piano. In the summer I got her a job at
the department store, but she didn't want to work. She just wants
to play the piano all day!"
It was our recommendation that the parents and daughter be given
an Activity Vector Analysis by one of the authors. In Chapter 10
entitled: "How to Motivate Others," you have read about Activity
Vector Analysis. These results were very revealing. We found
that the girl possessed ambitions, energies, and traits so far
beyond either of the parents that it would be difficult for them to
comprehend her reactions to them until they understood that each
person is different.
The parents thought that while it was nice to know how to play a
piano, it was good for a girl to work at home and work in a store
in the summer. A passion to be a pianist was just a waste of time.
"She will get married some day and will have to keep house. She
should be more practical," the parents reasoned.
The daughter's capacities and the tendencies that motivated her
were explained to the parents. Reasons were given why it was
303
hard for them to understand her. An explanation was also given to
the daughter as to why her parents thought one way and she
another. When the three endeavored to understand what brought
about their problem and how they could adjust to it with a
positive mental attitude, they were able to live together in greater
harmony.
To have a happy home, be understanding. To be happy, be
understanding of other people. Realize that another person's
energy level and capacities may not be the same as yours. He
may not think like you. Try to understand that what he likes may
not be what you like. When you realize this, you will find it
easier to develop a PMA in yourself and to do that which will
create desirable reactions in others.
Opposite poles of a magnet attract each other and do persons with
opposite personality traits. And where there is a community of
interest, two individuals may experience a happy association
together although each has opposite characteristics in many
respects. One may be ambitious, aggressive, confident, and
optimistic and possess tremendous drive, energy, and stick-to-
itiveness. The other may have a tendency to be satisfied, fearful,
timid, shy, tactful, and humble and may lack confidence in
himself. Often such persons are attracted to each other, and when
associated together complement, strengthen, and inspire each
other.
And they blend their personalities and thus the extremes of each
become neutralized. What would grow into rigidity on the part of
one and frustration on the part of the other is thus avoided.
Would you be happy and inspired if you were married to a person
whose personality was exactly like yours? Be truthful with
yourself. The answer would probably be "no."
304
Children, too, can be taught to be understanding and to be
appreciative of all that their parents do for them. Much
unhappiness is caused in homes because the children do not
appreciate and understand their parents. But whose fault is it?
The child's or the parents' or both?
Some time ago we had an appointment with the president of a
large and successful organization. His name has appeared in a
favorable light in every large newspaper in the country for the
good work he did while holding public office. Yet on the day we
saw him, he was most unhappy. "No one likes me! Even my
children hate me! Why is this?" he asked.
Actually this man is a person of good intent. He gave his children
everything that money would buy. He deliberately kept them
from the needs that forced him as a child to gain the strength he
developed as a man. He tried to protect them from those things in
life that to him were not beautiful. He eliminated the necessity for
them to struggle as he had had to struggle. He never asked or
expected appreciation from his sons and daughters when they
were children and he never got it. Yet he assumed that they
understood him without endeavoring to find out.
Things would have been different had he taught his children to be
appreciative and to gain strength by at least partially fighting their
own battles. He experienced happiness in making them happy
without teaching them to be happy by making others happy.
Therefore they made him unhappy. Perhaps if he had confided in
them when they were growing up and told of the struggles he had
endured for their benefit, they might have been more
understanding.
But there is no need for this man, or anyone in a like situation, to
remain unhappy. He can turn up the PMA side of his talisman
and try earnestly to make himself known to and understood by his
dear ones.
305
And he can take the time to show that he loves them by sharing
himself instead of just giving them those material things with
which his wealth can supply them. If he shares himself as
liberally as he shared his money with them, he will experience the
rich reward of having them return love and understanding to him.
Of course this man had meant well. He had the right intent
toward his children and toward others. But he had not been
sensitive to their reactions. He had simply assumed that they
would understand. And he had not taken the time to help them to
do so.
Now this man could help himself by reading inspirational books.
We recommended several including: How to Win Friends and
Influence People. And we told him that his children were people.
Attract and repel through verbal communications. Regardless
of who you are — you are a wonderful person! Yet certain
individuals may not think so. If you feel that they react
unfavorably with unwarranted antagonism to the many things you
say and do, you can do something about it. They are just as
human as you are.
You have the power to attract and repel! You can use this power
wisely to attract the right friends and repel those who have an
undesirable or injurious influence on you. With a negative mental
attitude — you are apt automatically to repel the good things in
life and attract the undesirable including the wrong kind of
friends.
Undesirable reactions on the part of others may be due to what
you say and how you say it; or because of your true inner feelings
and attitudes. The voice, like music, is often a reflection of the
mood, attitude, and hidden thoughts of the mind. It may be just as
difficult for you to realize that the fault lies with you as it is for
306
you to take the initiative and correct yourself when you realize
the fault does at times lie with you — but you can do it!
You can learn from a good salesman. For he is forced to train
himself to be sensitive to the reactions of prospective customers
— and do something about it.
The customer is always right attitude of successful merchants is a
most difficult attitude for some individuals to adopt; yet — it gets
results!
If you would endeavor to make your relatives happy with the
same positive mental attitude that a salesman uses to sell his
merchandise to prospective customers, your home and social life
would become a more happy and successful one — that is if you
have a problem of personality conflict at home.
If your feelings are frequently hurt because of what people say, or
how they say it, it is quite likely that you yourself are frequently
guilty of offending others by what you say or how you say it. Try
to determine the true reasons for your reactions of hurt feelings
and then avoid causing the same reactions in others.
If gossip offends you, you can assume that you shouldn't gossip
or you will offend others.
If you find someone's tone of voice and attitude towards you
objectionable, avoid offending others by speaking or acting in the
same manner.
If you are not happy when someone yells at you in an angry
voice, assume that it is repellent to another if you yell at him —
even though he is your five-year-old son, or a very close relative.
307
If you feel offended because another person misunderstands your
intent, show your confidence — give other persons the benefit
of the doubt.
If you do not find arguments, sarcasm, humor with a personal
sting, or criticism of your ideas, friends or relatives pleasant, it is
logical to assume that others will not find them pleasing either.
And if you like to be complimented — if you like to be
remembered — if it makes you happy to know that someone
thinks of you: you can safely assume that others will be happy if
you compliment them, or remember them, or drop them a note to
let them know you are thinking of them.
A letter can bring happiness. Absence makes the heart grow
fonder — if letters are exchanged. For many a marriage has taken
place because love grew stronger through absence.
Poetry, imagination, romance, idealism, ecstasy develop warmth
and understanding through the exchange of letters. Each
individual can express thoughts that might never be expressed if
the written word is not used as the medium. Letters of
endearment need not, and should not, stop with marriage. Samuel
Clemens (Mark Twain) wrote loving notes to his wife daily even
when they were at home. They lived a life of real happiness
together.
You are what you think. To write — you must think. When you
write a letter, you crystallize your thinking on paper. Your
imagination is developed by recollecting the past, analyzing the
present and perceiving the future. The more often you write, the
more you take pleasure in writing. By asking questions, you, as
the writer, direct the mind of the recipient into desired channels.
You can make it easy for him to respond to you. Thus, when he
308
does, he becomes the writer and you receive additional joy as the
recipient.
The receiver of the letter you write is forced to think in terms of
you. If your letter is well-thought-out, both his reason and his
emotions can be directed along desired paths. Inspiring thoughts
will be imprinted indelibly in his memory when they are being
recorded in his subconscious mind as he reads.
Can you attract happiness? Yes, of course you can attract
happiness. How? You can attract happiness with PMA.
A positive mental attitude will attract to you all the health,
wealth, and happiness you desire. And a positive mental attitude
consists of such plus characteristics as: faith, hope, charity,
optimism, cheer, generosity, tolerance, tact, kindliness, honesty,
good-finding, initiative, truthfulness, straightforwardness, and
good common sense.
Contentment. As a nationally syndicated columnist, Napoleon
Hill once wrote an article entitled "Contentment." You may find
it helpful. Here is what it said:
The richest man in all the world lives in Happy Valley. He
is rich in values that endure, in things he cannot lose —
things that provide him with contentment, sound health,
peace of mind and harmony within his soul.
Here is an inventory of his riches and how he acquired
them:
"I found happiness by helping others to find it.
"I found sound health by living temperately and eating
only the food my body requires to maintain itself.
309
"I hate no man, envy no man, but love and respect all
mankind.
"I am engaged in a labor of love with which I mix play
generously; therefore, I seldom grow tired.
"I pray daily, not for more riches, but for more wisdom
with which to recognize, embrace, and enjoy the great
abundance of riches I already possess.
"I speak no name save only to honor it, and I slander no
man for any cause whatsoever.
"I ask no favors of anyone except the privilege of sharing
my blessings with all who desire them.
"I am on good terms with my conscience; therefore, it
guides me accurately in everything I do.
"I have more material wealth than I need because I am
free from greed and covet only those things I can use
constructively while I live. My wealth comes from those
whom I have benefited by sharing my blessings.
"The estate of Happy Valley which I own is not taxable.
It exists mainly in my own mind, in intangible riches that
cannot be assessed for taxation or appropriated except by
those who adopt my way of life. I created this estate over
a   lifetime   of   effort   by   observing   nature's   laws   and
forming habits to conform with them."
There are no copyrights on the Happy Valley man's success
creed. If you will adopt it, the creed can bring you wisdom,
peace, and contentment.
310
In his book, The Power of Faith, Rabbi Louis Bienstock said this
on the subject of happiness:
"Man was born together — all of one piece. It is the kind of
world he has fashioned that has torn him apart. A world of folly!
A world of falsehood! A world of fear! With the power of faith,
let him put himself together again — faith in himself, faith in his
fellowmen, faith in his destiny, faith in his God. Then and only
then will the world be truly together. Then and only then will
man find happiness and peace."
Remember, if the man is right his world will be right, He can
attract happiness just as he can attract wealth, unhappiness, or
poverty. Is your world right? Or are guilt feelings keeping you
from winning the success you want? If so, you will want to read
our next chapter to insure happiness in your life.
PILOT NO. 18
Thoughts to Steer By
1. Abraham Lincoln once said: "It has been my observation that
people are just about as happy as they make up their minds to
be." Will you make up your mind to be happy? If not, will you
make up your mind not to be unhappy?
2. There is very little difference in people, but that little
difference makes a big difference. The little difference is
attitude. The big difference is whether it is positive or
negative.
3. One of the surest ways to find happiness for yourself is to
devote your energies toward making someone else happy.
311
4. If you search for happiness, you will find it elusive. But if you
try to bring happiness to someone else, it will return to you
many times over.
5. If you share happiness, and all that is good and desirable, you
will attract happiness, and the good and desirable.
6. If you share misery and unhappiness, you will attract misery
and unhappiness to yourself.
7. Happiness begins at home. Members of your family are
people. Motivate them to be happy just like a good salesman
motivates his prospects to buy.
8. When two forceful personalities are opposed and it is desirable
that they live together in harmony, at least one must use the
power of PMA.
9. Be sensitive to your own reactions and to the reactions of
others.
10. Would you like to live contentedly in Happy Valley?
TO BE HAPPY
MAKE OTHERS HAPPY!

CHAPTER 19
Get Rid of That Guilt Feeling
You have a guilt feeling. That's good!
But get rid of that feeling of guilt.
A sense of guilt is good. And every living person regardless of
how good or bad he may be will sometimes experience a feeling
of guilt. This feeling is the result of a "still, small voice" speaking
to you. And your conscience is that "still, small voice."
Now think for a moment: What would happen if one did not feel
a sense of guilt after doing wrong? For the person who does not
have a feeling of guilt for doing a specific wrong act is often
unable to distinguish between right and wrong — or hasn't been
trained to know the difference between right and wrong as
regards that act. Or he may not be sane.
For many feelings of guilt are inherited. And others are acquired.
We know a mental conflict often will develop when inherited
emotions and passions are bridled by the society in which one
lives; and people in one environment may have an entirely
different code of ethics that is opposed to the code of those in
another. Yet in each instance where the individual has been
taught a specific, ethical standard and violates it, he develops a
feeling of guilt.
In some instances, however, the violation of a moral standard of
society is good because the standard itself may be bad.
313
And we reiterate: a feeling of guilt is good: It even motivates
persons of the highest moral standards to worthwhile thought and
action.
For there was a righteous man who hated and unrelentingly
persecuted people of a religious minority. But he developed a
feeling of guilt. And the world knows he righted his wrong when
his feelings of guilt motivated him to desirable action. For he
became a great evangelist. And his thoughts, words, and actions
have changed the history of the world during the past two
thousand years. Saul of Tarsus was his name.
And then there was a man whose feeling of guilt for what he
believed to be the misdeeds of his life made him so remorseful
that he, too, was motivated to desirable action. In prison he spent
his days writing a book. And his book is a classic reference for
teaching nobility of character and beauty of life. John Bunyan
was his name.
And then there was also the sinner we discussed in Chapter
Fifteen who donated a half million dollars to the Chicago Boys
Clubs and who also donated a million dollars to his church. Now
he did this to atone in part for his guilt. For he provided money to
prevent boys and girls from falling into the traps and snares of
life that he had experienced.
Even a benefactor to mankind like Dr. Albert Schweitzer was
motivated by the sense of guilt. For he felt guilty that he had
fallen short of his responsibilities to his fellowmen. And because
he could, but was not, doing something worthwhile, his sense of
guilt prompted him to start his great mission.
Now do you see that a feeling of guilt with PMA is good? But
then there is a feeling of guilt with NMA. And that is bad.
314
For not every guilt feeling brings about beneficial remits. Now
when the individual has a guilt feeling and does not get rid of that
guilt feeling with PMA, the results are often most harmful.
And the great psychologist Sigmund Freud says: "The further our
work proceeds and the deeper our knowledge of the mental life of
neurotics penetrates, the more clearly two new factors force
themselves upon our notice which demand the closest attention as
sources of resistance... They can both be included under the one
description of 'need to be ill' or 'need to suffer.'... The first of
these two factors is the sense of guilt or consciousness of guilt..."
And Sigmund Freud is right. For feelings of guilt have motivated
men to destroy their lives, mutilate their bodies, or injure
themselves in other ways to atone for their wrongdoing. Now
today, fortunately, such methods are seldom practiced. And they
are not permitted in civilized countries. Yet their counterpart can
be found. For the conscious mind may not feel guilty but the
subconscious mind does.
And the subconscious mind never forgets.
And it uses its powers as effectively as the conscious mind. For it
fulfills the need of the individual who doesn't rid himself of the
feeling of guilt with PMA. It makes him ill. It makes him suffer.
A   guilt   feeling   can   teach   yon   consideration   for   others.
Consideration for others is a quality each of us has to learn to
develop. The new-born babe cares little for the comfort and
convenience of anyone else. He wants what he wants when he
wants it. So right at that point in his development he begins to
learn, little by little, that there are others alive, too, and that, to
some extent at least, he will have to allow them some
consideration. But selfishness is a common human trait, and it
lessens in each of us only through development. When we get old
315
enough to understand that such feelings are not good, we feel a
twinge of guilt when we indulge in selfishness. This is good, for
it causes us to think twice when the occasion arises and we can
choose between pleasing ourselves or pleasing others concerned.
Thomas Gunn's six-year-old grandson was visiting him at his
home in Cleveland, Ohio. The youngster would run to the corner
every evening to meet his grandfather when he returned from
work. This made the grandfather very happy. When the youngster
met him, he would give his grandson a small bag of candy.
One day the boy ran to the corner and greeted his grandfather in
excitement and anticipation with: "Where's my candy?" The
elderly gentleman tried to conceal his emotion. "Did you meet me
every evening," he hesitated before continuing, "just for a bag of
candy?" The boy was handed the small bag that his grandfather
had taken out of his pocket. Nothing more was said as they
walked to the house. The child was hurt. He was unhappy. He
didn't eat the candy. It didn't seem desirable any more. He had
injured someone whom he loved.
That night as the six-year-old and his grandfather knelt down and
said their prayers aloud together, the youngster added one all his
own: "Please, God, let grandfather know I love him."
The boy's unhappiness and remorse because of what he had done
were good. Why? Because they forced him to take action to get
rid of that guilt feeling and make amends for what he had done.
To get rid of that guilt feeling, make amends. Feelings of guilt
can arise from many varied causes. But a sense of guilt brings
with it a feeling of indebtedness... indebtedness that must be
reduced and eliminated.
316
And this is very well illustrated by the story of the young doctor
in Lloyd C. Douglas' novel The Magnificent Obsession. For you
will recall that in that story the young man who is the hero felt
that he owed the world a debt because his life had been saved at
the cost of the life of a great brain surgeon who had been a real
blessing to the world.
But it was this feeling of debt which caused the young man to
become a brain specialist equal in ability to the man whose life he
felt he had taken. And from the diary of the man who had gone
on, the young man learned a philosophy of life which caused him
to develop a Magnificent Obsession. Thus, because of his guilt
feeling, he too became a worthwhile person.
Now every story is somebody's story. And every day in your
daily newspaper you read somebody's story: someone like Jim
Vaus whose life was saved in more ways than one because he
responded to an irrevocable decision to get rid of his feeling of
guilt. For he got into action.
To get rid of that guilt feeling, get into action! Sometimes
people get caught in a web of wrongdoing, and they seem to be
unable to free themselves from it. For they give up trying. And
then they become more and more entangled, until finally it takes
an almost earthshaking experience to set them free. Such was the
case with Jim Vaus.
Jim Vaus is a man who literally owes his life to his decision to
say "I will" and yet this decision came quite late in life. For a
good many years, Jim had been running head on into the
Commandments. He seemed to be trying to violate them all, one
by one. The first time he broke the injunction, "Thou shalt not
steal," he was still in college. One day he stole $92.74; he went to
the airport, bought a ticket, and headed for Florida. A little later
he stole again, this time in an armed robbery. He was caught and
317
put in jail. Shortly thereafter he was granted amnesty so that he
could join the Army; yet even in the Army he got into trouble.
The court martial read, "... for diverting government property to
private use... "
And so it went. Jim Vaus' career kept sliding downhill. The more
often he did wrong, the more guilt he felt. Guilt leads to guilt, as
well as lies and deception to hide it.
Now Jim didn't consciously feel more guilty — because his
conscious sense of guilt had become deadened. But not so with
his subconscious mind. For that's where the guilt feeling
accumulated without Jim's realizing it.
And, as in the instances you often read of in your newspaper, it
took an earthshaking experience to awaken him.
Now Vaus was eventually released from the Army; he married
and moved to California where he set up an electronics consultant
business. One day a man known simply as Andy came to Jim and
outlined a big idea for beating the races with an electronic device.
Within weeks Jim was deeply involved with the underworld. And
he was driving a nine thousand dollar car. He had a fine home in
the suburbs, and more business than he could handle.
One day Jim had an argument with his wife. She wanted to know
where all the money was coming from, and he wouldn't say. So
she started to cry. Jim couldn't stand to see his wife cry. For he
loved her. Jim's conscience bothered him. Because he wanted to
humor her, he suggested a ride out to the beach. On the way, they
got caught in a traffic jam: hundreds of cars were pouring into a
parking lot.
"Oh look, Jim," said Alice. "It's Billy Graham! Let's go. It might
be interesting."
318
And still trying to humor her, Jim went along. But shortly after he
sat down he became emotionally disturbed: It seemed to him that
Graham was talking directly to him. For Jim's conscience
bothered him so badly that it seemed he had been singled out.
Graham's text was:
"What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses
his soul?"
Then Graham was saying:
"There's a man here who has heard all this before, who is
hardening his heart. With pride he stiffens his neck, and he is
determined to leave without making a decision. But this will be
his last chance."
His last chance? To Jim the thought was startling. Perhaps he had
a premonition. Or perhaps he was ready. What did the preacher
mean?
Graham was giving a call to come forward. He wanted people to
take a physical step that symbolized a decision. What was
happening, Jim wondered. Why did he feel like crying? Suddenly
he found himself speaking. "Let's go, Alice." Dutifully Alice
walked to the aisle, and turned as if to go out of the tent. Jim,
who was following her, caught her arm and turned her around.
"No, dear," he said. "This way... "
Years later, after Jim had changed his life completely, he was
giving a speech in Los Angeles. And then he told of his
experiences with the underworld. He told about the day of his
decision, on which day he had been instructed to fly to St. Louis
on a wire-tapping assignment. "I never reached St. Louis," he
said. "I found the courage to reach my knees instead."
319
And in his speech Jim told of his blessings and how he had
thanked God for them, asked for forgiveness, had tried to
neutralize his wrongdoing, and stressed the application of the
Golden Rule.
After the lecture, a lady came up to him and said, "Mr. Vaus, I
think you might like to know something. I was working in the
Mayor's office at the time you were supposed to go to St. Louis.
On that day a teletype was received from the FBI. It said, Mr.
Vaus, that you were going to be met in St. Louis by a rival gang.
And shot dead."
A recommended formula for getting rid of guilt. Your own
"last chance" may not be as dramatic as this. But there is a
wonderful lesson in the story of Jim Vaus, nonetheless. How was
Jim able to get rid of his guilt feelings? He did it by following a
clearcut pattern. It is the pattern all of us can follow.
... First of all, you listen as you hear advice, a lecture, an
inspirational sermon that could change your life.
... Then you count your blessings, and thank God for
them. Feel sincerely sorry and ask for forgiveness. When
you realize your blessings, it isn't difficult to become
sincerely sorry for the wrongs you have done. And truly
to repent Then you will have the courage to ask for
forgiveness from God.
... You must take the first step forward. This is important
because it is a symbol through a physical gesture that you
make in the direction of a changed life. When Jim walked
down the aisle, he was making a public announcement
that he had become sorry for his past and was now ready
to change his life.
320
... Also, you must make amends by taking the second
step forward: begin immediately to right every wrong.
... And then the most important step of all: apply the
Golden Rule. This should be easy. For now when you are
tempted to do wrong, that "still, small voice" will whisper
to you. And when it does, stop and listen. Count your
blessings. Picture yourself in the other fellow's place. And
then make your decision to do what you would want
done if you actually were in his position.
So this is the formula for getting rid of your guilt feelings. If you
are having trouble with temptation, and if subsequent guilt is
keeping you from using your energy in a constructive direction,
learn the pattern for freedom from guilt Relate it to your own life.
Apply it. And step away toward success.
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude urges you to use the
powers of your conscious and subconscious mind to:
• Seek the truth.
• Motivate you to take constructive action.
• Cause you to strive to achieve the highest ideals you can
conceive, consistent with good physical and mental health.
• Live intelligently in your society.
• Help you abstain  from that which will cause unnecessary
injury.
• Start you from where you are and get you to where you want
to be regardless of what you are or what you have been.
Anything which deters you from noble achievements in life
should be cast aside. And this places upon you the burden to
know or find out what is right or wrong, and to know what is
good or evil under a given circumstance and at a given time.
321
You are acquainted with the Ten Commandments, the Golden
Rule, and other standards of good in the society in which you
live. And it is for you to determine the standards which will guide
you to your desired goals.
"It is one thing to know the goal, and quite another thing to work
toward it," writes Bishop Fulton J. Sheen in Life Is Worth Living.
Choose your goals! Work toward them! Direct your thoughts,
control your emotions, get into action and you ordain your
destiny. You can find the answer if you keep seeking it. How?
One important aid is to "catch character."
Catch. "Character is something that is caught, not taught," was a
thought-provoking quotation of Arthur Burger, former Executive
Director of the Boys Clubs of Boston. It appeared in a Reader's
Digest article entitled "400,000 Boys Are Members of the Club."
Catch has two distinct meanings: (1) "affected by exposure to
environment" (often subconscious reaction); and (2) "seize and
hold" (conscious action).
One effective way to catch character is to place yourself or your
children in an environment that will develop desirable thoughts,
motives, and habits. If your selected environment it is not
sufficiently effective after a reasonable time, make substitutions
and changes.
But character can also be taught. And if parents would devote
more time to teaching character, both by precept and example,
their children would catch and learn this admirable quality so
necessary for success.
What makes a delinquent? E. E. Bauermeister, former
Supervisor of Education at the California Institution for Men at
Chino, California, says: "Our youngsters need the guidance in
322
choosing right from wrong which they should receive at home...
when we start talking about juvenile delinquency, we should
rename it and put the responsibility where it belongs. We have a
case of parent delinquency in America today. Parents are not
assuming the obligations and responsibilities that are theirs.
"Everyone has been born with a potential of good character... "
J. Edgar Hoover made this statement: "You can read volumes
upon volumes as to the cause of crime, but crime is literally
caused by the lack of one thing, a feeling of moral responsibility
on the part of people."
And the reason the people lack a feeling of moral responsibility is
because they lack a guilt feeling. Thus they do not develop their
own characters, for their conscience is dulled and doesn't guide
them. And from their faulty unmoral and amoral characters their
children can neither catch nor learn character.
When one virtue is in conflict with another. Sometimes it is not
so easy to decide whether one should say yes or no. For the
question to be resolved may involve a conflict between virtues.
And every person at some time is faced with such a conflict and
must make a decision. He must choose: between what he wishes
to do and what he ought to do; or between what he wants and
what society expects of him.
And such a choice must necessarily be made between virtues,
such as: love, duty, and loyalty. As examples: (a) love and duty to
a parent in conflict with the love and duty to a husband or wife;
(b) loyalty to an individual in conflict with loyalty to another
individual; or (c) loyalty to an individual in conflict with loyalty
to an organization or society.
323
Let's Illustrate with the story of the salesmen who worked with
George Johnson. For they were faced with a conflict between
loyalty to an individual and loyalty to another Individual and the
organization he represented.
George Johnson trained, encouraged, inspired, and financed a
salesman whom we will call John Black.
George had complete confidence in John. He liked him. He gave
him a break. He let him service his best customers — long
established accounts. In the company contract it was agreed that
in the event of termination the salesman would in no way molest
the company's business or interfere with its sales organization.
Mr. Johnson gave Black the book Think and Grow Rich. It
motivated John to action — the wrong action! John didn't read
what was unwritten. His only interest was the acquisition of
money. He believed the end justified any means. Because of his
negative standards he responded aggressively with a negative
mental attitude.
"George Johnson is just like a father to me. Yes, I think of him as
a father," the salesman said, but at the same time he secretly
planned to transfer the company's customers and sales force to a
competing concern for — money.
John was welcomed in the homes of his fellow salesmen. For
they were unaware of his thoughts or plans. When he called at
their homes he relied upon the honesty and decency of the
individuals to live up to a promise and not to betray his secret. He
would ask, "How would you like to double your earnings? How
would you like to have greater security?" The response would be:
"Sounds good! What's it all about?"
324
Black would answer, "I don't want anyone to upset the apple cart;
therefore, I'll tell you only if you promise me on your honor not to
tell anyone. Do you make a solemn promise?"
When the answer was yes, he endeavored to entice them over to
the competing organization. He tried to neutralize their pangs of
conscience by referring to real or imaginary dissatisfactions.
The other salesmen were "on the spot." On the one hand, they had
given John their solemn promise not to tell what he was doing.
On the other hand, they knew what he was doing would be
harmful to their employer. And they owed a greater loyalty to
George Johnson and the organization he represented.
The salesmen had the courage to try to clear the cobwebs of
John's thinking and to show him that what he was contemplating
was not right. When he didn't respond but persisted in his own
way, they knew what to do: They gave George Johnson the facts.
They chose adherence to courage, honesty, and loyalty. They
knew how to decide between right and wrong when one virtue
was in conflict with another.
There are many such conflicts. In your life you will be faced with
the necessity to make decisions in instances where virtues are in
conflict with other virtues. And what will your decision be?
Perhaps the following will aid you:
Do that which your conscience tells you will not develop a guilt
feeling. It's the right thing to do. To assist you in coming to the
right decision under such circumstances, complete the Success
Quotient Analysis in the following chapter.

Thoughts to Steer By
325
1. You have a guilt feeling. That's good! But get rid of that guilt
feeling!
2. To get rid of that guilt feeling, make amends.
3. A recommended formula to help you get rid of guilt is:
(a) Listen to advice, a lecture, sermon, etc., and relate and
assimilate the principles.
(b) Count your blessings and thank God for them.
(c) Then become truly sorry for your wrongdoings. True
sorrow necessarily incorporates a sincere decision to stop
the wrongdoing.
(d) Take the first step forward: Acknowledge your guilt
and   your  intention to make amends.
(e) Make amends insofar as you are able.
(f) Memorize, understand and try to apply the Golden Rule
in your dealings with others.
4. Anything which deters you from noble achievements in life
should be cast aside.
5. Character can be caught and taught.
6. What do you do when two virtues are in conflict with one
another?
7. The burden is upon you to find what is right or wrong, and to
know what is good or evil under a given circumstance and at a
given time. One of the best ways to learn is to expose yourself
with regularity to a religious environment, and to seek Divine
Guidance daily.
YOU HAVE A GUILT FEELING — THAT'S GOOD.
BUT GET RID OF THAT GUILT FEELING!
326
PARTV
Action Please!
NEGLIGENCE
Remember that you and you alone can eliminate your real
limitations when you learn and employ the art of motivation with
PMA. These limitations are:
1. A negative mental attitude and your neglect to change to a
positive mental attitude
2. Ignorance, through your neglect, to learn how to use the
powers of your mind
3. Your neglect to engage in thinking, study and planning time to
set and achieve desirable goals
4. Your neglect to take the necessary action when you know what
to do and how to do it
5. Your neglect to learn how to recognize, relate, assimilate and
apply universal principles that, when applied, can help you
achieve any objective you may have that doesn't violate the
laws of God or the rights of your fellow men
6. That which you set up in your own mind, or accept, as
insurmountable
Also remember: Negligence is one of the quickest and easiest
habits to neutralize and overcome if you want to neutralize and
overcome it.

CHAPTER 20
Now It's Time to Test Your Own Success Quotient
You have read all but the last three chapters of Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude. And now would be a good time to take
a look at your own mental attitude. And you can do this for
yourself.
But before you do, we want you to know our attitude is:
The burden of teaching is upon the person who wants to teach.
And with whom does the burden of learning lie? Perhaps J.
Milburn Smith has the answer. Now J. Milburn Smith rose from
assistant to the office boy to president of the Continental Casualty
Company of Chicago. He told us:
The burden of learning is on the person who wants to learn, not
on the person who wants to teach. And he also said:
"A 'have-not' is a person who believes that an idea is not good for
him unless he himself originates it. And I say:
"Copy from success! Everything I have done I have borrowed
from another person or business." And he continued:
"Be respectful and listen to those who have experience.
"For the experienced man had something I wanted. And that's
why I associated with older and successful men. For I took what
they had: the good, their knowledge and experience, but not their
weaknesses. And then I added this to what I had. Thus I profited
even by their mistakes as well as my own.
328
To learn one must pay the price. And I was willing to pay it for I
was not taught. I learned. Knowledge? You must seek it out!"
Copy from success, says J. Milburn Smith.
And you can begin by asking yourself some questions: Am I
willing to pay the price? Am I willing to take the good, the
knowledge and the experience, but not the weaknesses of the men
I have read about in this book?
And if your answer is yes, then we have a suggestion that we
know will help you. But let's first remind you that as you have
read the pages of this book, you have frequently been called upon
to answer questions about yourself. And although these may have
appeared to have been simple questions, in reality: is there
anything harder than to evaluate one's self correctly? "Know
thyself" is probably the most difficult admonition ever given to
man.
And to assist you to know thyself the authors have prepared a
personal analysis questionnaire which has helped many men and
women to do this more satisfactorily. You have already taken
many tests intelligence, aptitude, personality, vocabulary, and all
the rest.
But this one is different. We call it your Success Quotient
Analysis. And it is based on the 17 success principles which have
been responsible for the worthwhile achievements of the world's
outstanding leaders in all fields. It has many purposes:
To direct your thoughts in desired channels.
To crystallize your own thinking.
To indicate your present position on the road to success.
To encourage you to decide exactly where you want to be.
329
To    measure    your    chances    of    reaching    your    desired
destination.
To indicate your present ambitions and other characteristics.
To motivate you to desirable action with PMA.
Our suggestion. And now our suggestion is that you
immediately try to answer the following Success Quotient
Analysis: thoughtfully and truthfully, to the best of your ability.
Try not to fool yourself. For this test will be valid only if you
answer every question with the truth as you now see it.

You have tried to answer the questions in this Success Quotient
Analysis searchingly and honestly. If not, you will. Now the
important thing to remember is that these results are not final and
unchangeable. If you scored high, it means you will be able to
assimilate and practice the principles in this book rather quickly.

When you need help from a psychologist to find out what
business or profession you may be fitted for, he will frequently
ask you to take a battery of tests.
The picture that emerges from these tests may show you what
your particular tendencies are. However, the psychologist does
not regard the result of these tests as final. He always arranges for
a personal interview to find out that which a test will not answer.
He uses the results of the tests and the interview to counsel you
and to evaluate your progress.
In the same way you can use the first score on the questionnaire
as a means of measuring your own ever-growing success-
quotient.
Read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude from cover to
cover once more. And again. And again. Read it aloud with your
husband, wife, or a close friend, discussing it point by point.
Read it until every principle becomes a part of your life,
motivating your every action.
Then, when you have earnestly applied these principles for three
months, take the S.Q. test again. Not only will many wrong
answers become right ones, but answers you gave correctly the
first time will be more emphatic and confident.
Your Success Quotient can serve you as more than a yardstick,
however. It can serve to underline those areas where you need to
work hardest for self-improvement. It will also reveal your areas
of special strength.

2. There is a value in solving problems or developing desirable
habits by asking yourself the proper questions. Write them down,
and then, in your thinking time, strive to find the proper solutions
to obtain the results you desire.

CHAPTER 21
Awaken the Sleeping Giant
Within You
You are the most important living person.
"Stop and think about yourself: In all the history of the world
there was never anyone else exactly like you, and in all the
infinity of time to come, there will never be another."
You are the product of your: heredity, environment, physical
body, conscious and subconscious mind, experience, and
particular position and direction in time and space... and
something more, including powers known and unknown.
You have the power to affect, use, control or harmonize with all
of them. And you can direct your thoughts, control your emotions
and ordain your destiny with PMA.
For you are a mind with a body.
And your mind consists of dual, invisible gigantic powers: the
conscious and subconscious. One is a giant that never sleeps. It is
called the subconscious mind. The other is a giant which when
asleep is powerless. When awakened, his potential power is
unlimited. This giant is known as the conscious mind. When the
two work in harmony, they can affect, use, control or harmonize
with all known and unknown powers.
What wouldst thou have? "What wouldst thou have? I am ready
to obey thee as thy slave — I and the other slaves of the lamp,"
said the genie.
341
Awaken the sleeping giant within you! It is more powerful than
all the genii of Aladdin's lamp! The genii are fictional. Your
sleeping giant is real!
What wouldst thou have? Love? Good health? Success? Friends?
Money? A home? A car? Recognition? Peace of mind? Courage?
Happiness? Or, would you make your world a better world in
which to live? The sleeping giant within you has the power to
bring your wishes into reality.
What wouldst thou have? Name it and it's yours. Awaken the
sleeping giant within you! How?
Think. Think with a positive mental attitude.
Now the sleeping giant, like the genie, must be summoned with
magic. But you possess this magic. The magic is your talisman,
with the symbols PMA on one side and NMA on the other. The
characteristics of PMA are the plus characteristics symbolized by
such words as faith, hope, honesty, and love.
You are launched on a great journey. We have called the
resumes at the end of the chapters "pilots." That is because you
are going somewhere. You are not standing still. You are on your
way through rough and often unfamiliar waters. To reach the end
of your journey successfully, you will need many of the skills of
the navigator. As the compass of a ship is affected by disturbing
magnetic influences, requiring the pilot to make certain
allowances in order to keep the vessel on its right course, so you
must take account of the powerful influences affecting you as you
navigate through life.
A compass is corrected to give true readings regardless of
variation and deviation. The same applies to life where the
variations are environmental influences. And the deviations are
342
the negative attitudes within your own conscious and
subconscious mind. You must correct these deviations as they
occur in your plotting.
Ahead of you may be disappointments, adversities, and dangers.
These are the rocks and hidden shoals past which you must sail
on your course. And this you can do when your compass is
compensated for variation. For if you are aware of the coral reefs
and tides, you can capitalize on each. You can select the
environmental influence of the light of a lighthouse or sound of a
buoy to steer a course that will bring you towards your
destination without serious mishap.
Now when plotting a course, you must rely upon the accuracy of
your compass. Compensating the compass is not an exact science.
A necessary safeguard is unceasing watchfulness on the
navigator's part. It is possible, however, to correct a compass very
effectively.
Just as a magnetic needle is in direct line with the north and south
magnetic poles, so when your compass is compensated, you will
automatically react in line with your objective, your highest ideal.
And the highest ideal of man is the will of God.
This book will now go with you on your journey to success.
Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude will bring you
success, wealth, physical, mental and spiritual health, and
happiness when — you react favorably to it. Remember what
Andrew Carnegie said:
'Anything in life worth having is worth working for." Awaken the
sleeping giant! In the next chapter entitled "The Amazing Power
of a Bibliography" you will discover the art of reading an
inspirational book in a manner that will help you to awaken the
sleeping giant within you.

CHAPTER 22
The Amazing Power of
a Bibliography
This chapter is a bibliography. And this bibliography has
amazing potential power. For within it may lie the hidden button
which pushed can be used to unleash the power within you — the
untapped, unused vast resources that you alone possess. And we
hope it will start a chain reaction that will help you in achieving
true success. For if you want to motivate yourself and others: Say
it with a book.
Say it with a book. In Success Through a Positive Mental
Attitude the authors have used a technique that has proved
exceedingly effective in their writings, lectures, and counseling
service. We recommend self-help books which experience has
proved cause a desirable and positive reaction in the reader.
Now in the twentieth century, America has been particularly
fortunate in developing a group of authors who have the unique
talent to write in a manner that sows seeds of thought which
motivate those who are searching for self-improvement to find it.
The reader reacts with desirable action.
While some of the books we recommend are out of print, the
universal truths contained in them are just as true today as the day
they were written. And such books can be obtained from used
bookstores or rented from your library.
Again we urge you to read, study, understand, and apply the
principles in inspirational, self-help action books, magazines and
newspaper articles. Read everything you can find about those
who had successful careers in your own field to determine what
principles you can use to succeed. Also read success stories about
345
people in other kinds of work and find the common denominator,
the principle involved.
Share with others a part of what you possess that is good and
desirable: an inspirational, self-help action book, article, editorial
or poem.
Now, that's what Nate Lieberman has done. For many years he
was a manufacturer's representative. He had a Magnificent
Obsession. Over a period of years, he shared thousands of
inspirational books with his friends. And it was Nate Lieberman
who made Emerson and Mr. Stone close friends with a gift of
Emerson's Essays. And likewise he introduced him to the authors
of Suggestion and Autosuggestion, The Law of Psychic
Phenomena and Invention and The Unconscious, and many more.
Now this sharing of ideas and ideals is a marvelous thing — you
give them away and still keep them for yourself, too.
Brownie Wise knew this. Brownie needed to support herself and
her son, who was ill. Her meager salary wasn't enough to pay for
her son's medical care. Therefore she obtained a part-time sales
job for Tupperware Home Parties, Inc., to augment her income.
She needed money. With it, her son could have the best medical
attention. They could move to a climate that would help restore
his health. Brownie Wise prayed for help. She found it.
She read an inspirational book, Think and Grow Rich. She read it
once and then read it again. In fact. Brownie read the book six
times. Then she recognized the principles she was looking for and
something happened. She made it happen! She saw how she
could apply these principles to her own situation and these ideas
were put into action. It wasn't long before her earnings from
Tupperware exceeded $18,000 a year. And within a few years,
346
her income rose to over $75,000 annually. In due course she
became vice-president and general manager of the company.
Brownie Wise enjoyed the distinction of being recognized as one
of the outstanding woman sales managers in the United States.
She continued her successful career and eventually became
president of Viviane Woodard Cosmetics Corporation.
This outstanding business woman's success began with a book
and continued with a book. Much of her achievement is due to
the successful motivation of her representatives. She shared what
she had learned from reading Think and Grow Rich. Brownie
Wise bought copies of the book for her sales representatives.
They were urged to read Think and Grow Rich as many times as
she had, and to apply the principles in their own lives.
And the story of Lee S. Mytinger and William S. Casselberry,
Ph.D., is another example of the value of inspirational, self-help
action books in the achievement of success. These men helped
nature bring good health to men, women, and children through
the sale of Nutrilite, a food supplement which contains vitamins
and minerals. Their sales grossed many millions of dollars
annually.
Mytinger and Casselberry read Think and Grow Rich. They
assimilated what they read and got into action. Part of their
success was due to their ability to motivate their distributors with
mental and spiritual vitamins. They did this with the same book
that had inspired them. Each new employee received an
inspirational lecture course teaching him the fundamentals of
success. They distributed thousands of self-help books because
they knew what amazing effects these books have on sales repre-
sentatives' productivity and success.
W. Clement Stone uses inspirational literature extensively in his
organization.   His   company   buys   thousands   of   books   for
347
distribution to employees, stockholders, and representatives. The
success and growth of his companies have been phenomenal —
not by accident.
How to read a book. There is an art to reading a self-help book.
When you read, concentrate. Read as if the author were a close
personal friend and were writing to you — and you alone.
Now you recall that Abraham Lincoln, when he read, took time
for reflection in order that he might relate and assimilate the
principles into his own experience. It would be wise to follow his
good example.
Determine what you are looking for before you read a self-help
book. If you know what you are looking for you are more apt to
find it than if you don't have a specific purpose. If you really
want to recognize, relate, assimilate and apply success principles
that are contained between the covers of an inspirational book,
you must work at it. A self-help book is not to be skimmed
through the same way that you might read a detective novel.
Mortimer /. Adler in How to Read a Book urges the reader to
follow a definite pattern. Here's an ideal one:
Step A. Read for general content. This is the first reading. It
should be a fast reading, to grasp the sweeping flow of
thought that the book contains. But take the time to
underline the important words and phrases. Write notes
in the margins and write down briefly the ideas that
flash into your mind as you read. Now this obviously
may only be done with a book that you own. But the
notations and markings make your book more valuable
to you.
Step B. Read for particular emphasis. A second reading is for
the purpose of assimilating specific details. You should
348
pay particular attention to see that you understand and
really grasp any new ideas the book presents.
Step C. Read for the future. This third reading is more of a
memory feat than it is a reading task. Literally
memorize passages that have particular meaning to you.
Find ways they can relate to problems you are currently
facing. Test new ideas; try them; discard the useless and
imprint the useful indelibly on your habit patterns.
Step D. Read — later— to refresh your memory, and to rekindle
your inspiration. There is a famous story about the
salesman who is standing up in front of a sales manager
saying: '"Gimme that old sales talk again, I'm getting
kinda discouraged." All of us may become discouraged.
We should re-read the best of our books at such times
to rekindle the fires that got us going in the first place.
We shall list some inspirational, self-help action books (a few are
instructional) that can motivate you to desirable action. Each
contains hidden treasures that you can discover for yourself.
But before you go over the list and thus complete your first
reading of Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, let us
once more remind you: share with others apart of what you have
that is good and desirable, and awaken the sleeping giant within
you. Then this book, Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude,
will not be an ending. It will be the beginning of a new era in
your life.
Make the ending what you choose.

The Bible
(a) Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and

13:13-14)

(i) Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock
and it shall be opened unto you. (Matthew 7:7)

in prison, and ye came unto me. (Matthew 25:31-35)
(k) Go ye into all the world. (Mark 16:15)
(1) For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
not, that I do. (Romans 7:19)
350

Thoughts to Steer By
1. Like Brownie Wise, Mytinger and Casselberry, W. Clement
Stone and many other managers of successful sales
organizations, you can motivate yourself and others to desirable
action with inspirational self-help books — books that can be
evaluated by actual results achieved by the reader.
2. Brownie Wise found it necessary to read Think and Grow Rich
six times before she recognized the principles that she could
apply. Then something happened. She made it happen.
Develop your mind power by studying Success Through a
Positive Mental Attitude as often as is necessary to understand
how to achieve any desirable goal that doesn't violate the laws
of God or the rights of your fellow men.
3. When you read an inspirational, self-help action book:
(a) Concentrate.
(b) Read as if the author were a close personal friend and were
writing to you — and you alone.
(c) Know what you are looking for.
(d) Get into action — try the principles that are recommended.
4. Evaluate the book Success   Through a Positive Mental Attitude
by what you actually think and do to make yourself a better
359
person, and to make your world a better world for you and
others to live in.
5. You are a better person and your world will be a better world in
which to live because you have read Success through a Positive
Mental Attitude. Isn't that true?
SUCCEED THOUGH PMA—
YOU CAN IF YOU REALLY WANT TO!
DO YOU?
