INTRODUCTION.
Speaking of places of Christian worship, Hooker
says " Our repair thither is especially for mutual
conference and, as it were, commerce to be had
between God and us;"* and whatever tends to
defeat this end, or, indeed, does not forward it, can
hardly fail to be prejudicial to the spiritual life of
the Church.
A distinguished physicist has been lieard to de-
scribe, almost in the same breath with the avowal of
his inability to join in any religious service, as such,
the great enjoyment which he derived from listening
to anthems, chanting and hymns. In the province
of devotion this was an example of what we may
conceive to take place in that of religious teaching
and exhortation. The attraction of able and in-
teresting literary exercitations may not only gather
to the pulpit an auditory which neither seeks nor is
likely to derive any spiritual benefit from such
hearing, but may seriously mislead  many  persons

who are not insensible of their need of that help
which preachini^ is divinely appointed to afford. If
they have but listened to the preacher with a moderate
degree of attention, and still more if they have had
any kind of unobjectionable pleasure in hearing him,
they may go away persuaded that they have realised
all the benefit of the ordinance, and fulfilled all
their duty towards it; and yet its effect upon them
may not have been at all more spiritual or religious
than was that of sacred harmonies in the instance
which has just been mentioned.* The notion that
a religious duty is done when its forms have been
perfunctorily observed, and well done when this has
been accomplished pleasantly or easily, is but a
variety of the theory of the oj)us o]peratum, and
a very dangerous one too, because it is not so
obviously and repulsively superstitious as are some
of those which an enlightened Christianity will
unhesitatingly reprobate.t
* " It is certain that a sermon,
the conclusion whereof makes
the auditory look pleased, and
sets them all a-talking one with
another, was either not right
spoken or not right heard."—
Burnet's ' Pastoral Care,' c. ix.
t In this connection I may be
allowed to quote the following:—
" Many persons were found at
Church for the great Christian
ceremonies, and at the theatres
or even at the temples, for the
heathen spectacles. The ritual
of the Church was viewed as a
theatrical exhibition. The ser-
mons were listened to as the
displays of rhetoricians; and elo-
quent preachers were cheered
with clapping of hands, stamping
of feet, waving of handkerchiefs,
cries of' Orthodox'! ' Thirteenth
Apostle'! and other like demon-
strations, which such teachers as
Chrysostom and Augustine often
tried  to restrain, in  order that

At the same time it is easy to justify, though
not without some reservation, the policy of making
the service of the sanctuary attractive to the culti-
vated intellect as well as to a refined taste. The
kind of considerations which may be allowed to
prevail in recommendation of an element which is
ceremonious, spectacular and sensuous in worship,
may be extended with much less hesitation to
efforts by \\hich the intelligence of the community
is sought to be conciliated towards the ministra-
tions of the pulpit. It is surely a gain if minds
which cannot otherwise be reached and feelings
which cannot otherwise be moved by holy in-
fluences  are,   in  any  way  which   is  not  in  itself
they might persuade their flocks
to a more profitable manner of
hearing. Some went to churt-h !
for the sermon only, alleging that
they could pray at home. And
when the more attractive parts
of the service were over, the great
mass of the people departed,
without remaining for the ad-
ministration of the Eucharist.
.... Things which would have
been good either as expressions
of devotion or as means of training
for it, became through their mul-
tiplication, and through the im-
4)ortance which was attached to
them, too likely to be regarded
as independent ends.'—Eobert-
son, ' Hi.story of the Christian
Church,' Book II., c. vi., p. 356.
Truly history,  ecclesiastical   as
well as civil, repeats itself. Let
any one go to St. Paul's Cathedral,
at an ordinary Sunday morning
service, if he would see, that not
only, as is the case in nearly every
church, " without remaining for
the administration of the Eucha-
rist," but without even remaining
to take away the text of the
sermon, a great part of the con-
gregation will still depart when
the more attractive, i.e. the musi-
cal, portion of the service is over.
It is impossible, however, to be
too thankful for the improvement
whicli has taken place of late
years in the reverent and devo-
tional tone and aspect as well
as in the general " rendering"
of the St. Paul's services.
Vlll INTRODUCTION.
prejutlicial or unlawful, bi-ouglit into a contact
with sacred things from whicli spiritual profit may,
at any rate, be fairly ho[ied for. Let us take
the case of the Bible itself. If that Holy Volume
had contained nothing but what the dullest might
understand, the most unlettered interpret, and the
most disputatious agree about, a large number
of those who now study it diligently, and not
without advantage to their souls, would, for want
of intellectual stimulus, read it, if at all, with
most unprofitable distaste and weariness. Given,
as it is, in a form whicli affords occasions so
numerous and of such great variety for mental
activity and power to be applied to it, many are
drawn and fixed to its pages by the pleasant sense of
a healthful and (so to say) manly intellectual exer-
cise, and are thus familiarised with objects, modes
of thought, and principles of conduct which are
calculated to direct and colour those higher faculties
whereby the soul of man can hold converse with
Heaven. And that which is true of the Word written,
is also true of the Word preached. The first point is
to get an attentive and respectful hearing for it.
This secured, it becomes comparatively easy to turn
that hearing to its proper account.
But as, in the case of worship, the ceremonial will
be anything but justifiable if it interposes a conceal-
ing or obscuring medium between the worshipper
and the object of his worship, so, in that of preaching,

it is not enough that its auditory is collected in a
consecrated building, and that its utterances proceed
from a gowned or surpliced orator, mounted in a pulpit.
Call it by what name we will—a discourse, a lecture,
an address, a homily, or what not—the ideal which
is implied in the designation sermon, should never
be lost sight of, always be distinctly aimed at. " So
worthy a part of divine service," says Hooker, " we
should greatly wrong if we did not esteem Preaching
as the blessed ordinance of God, sermons as keys
to the kingdom of heaven, as wings to the soul, as
spurs to the good affections of man, unto the sound
and healthy as food, as physic unto diseased minds; "*
and directly or indirectly—more (as I venture to
think) directly than indirectly—these purposes ought
to be subserved whenever a Christian congregation
is addressed from a Christian pulpit by a Christian
minister.
No opinion is here intended as to what is called
the greater utilisation of our Churches and Cathe-
drals by allowing semi-secular Lectures or Addresses
to be delivered in them. This may or may not
be defensible and expedient. The Society for Pro-
moting Christian Knowledge is not denied to be
within its functions in issuing books, provided they
are written in a religious spirit, that fall under
the  designation  of  " General  Literature," and  so

X INTRODUCTION.
possibly it may be beld that, at least upon week-
days, and with adequate safeguards (if such could be
devised), we should do well to open our Churches
for purposes auxiliary to religious ends, though not
directly and distinctively directed to them. 'J'his is
a question which it would be out of place to discuss
here. The discourses in this volume were delivered
at a regular Sunday service, and what was sought
was to reconcile their introduction there with those
views of the proper use of the pul})it at such times,
which have ever prevailed, and I devoutly trust ever
will prevail, in our own and nearly every other
Christian communion. The aim was that in their
effect upon the congregation they should be sermons,
in accordance with the description quoted above
from Hooker, and be distinctly understood and felt
to be such. It was earnestly desired that they
should not cause the Church in which they were
delivered to be regarded as a kind of ecclesiastical
Lecture Hall—a Royal lustitution for Sundays—as
in former times certain London chapels w^re said to
relieve the tedium of the day by furnishing persons
who could not make up their minds to ' miss
Church' altogether, with the opportunity of whiling
away a weary hour at a Sunday opera.
This object, as I thought. Mould not be attained,
nor the danger avoided, if certain great English
divines were treated generally, so that the discourses
devoted to them should form so many portraits in

the gallery of the National Chiircli, so many chap-
ters in its history, or so many articles in its bio-
graphical dictionary.    The proposal of a Series of
Lectures, to be delivered in the Chapel of Kin
College, upon " The IMasters in English Theology
was almost simultaneous with that of the discourses
in this volume; and when my friend Canon Barry
mentioned it to me, with the expression of a hope
that I might not think it would clash Avith mine,
I at once welcomed it with cordial approval.    The
pulpit of an  educational institution,  of which  the
theological department forms the  most prominent
and the most important feature—of which, indeed,
it may be said that the theological is the distinc-
tive character t—is undoubtedly most legitimately
employed in such teaching as those Lectures  are
intended to communicate; especially as there is no
pastoral charge connected  with the chapel, and it
cannot be considered—its size alone would prevent
that—to su])ply to the students in general the place
of a parish  Church.     But the very title of those
Lectures at once points to an auditory of a different

Ivind from that which was either wished or likely to
be gathered in St. James's Church at the delivery
of this present series. That title has, at least, an " ad
clerum'' look or sound, whereas, in my scheme,
although a higher than the average intelligence of a
parochial congregation was certainly aimed at, it was
the " ad ijopulum" character that I was supremely
anxious should prevail, as being more consistent, if
I should not say alone consistent, with the time,
the place, and the circumstances of its designation.
And it was for this reason that none of the great
Anglican divines but such as were known and dis-
tinguished as iweacliers were included in the series,
and that those who were included were required to
be treated with especial reference to their sermons.
This treatment was intended to be completely secured
by annexing to each of their names a designation
descriptive of the peculiar characteristic of the
preaching of each. The attempt was one of some
little difficulty, and it is doubtful whether it can
be successfully extended to as many more of our
great preachers without repetition. So far as they
have gone, however, the designations seem to be
neither fanciful nor, in any instance, other than
accurate.
How the great ends of Christian preaching were
considered to be promoted by such treatment of
such subjects must now be explained.

what and how they hear.* It would be straining
these cautions from their true meaning and purpose
to apply them directly to the due estimate of what
Christian preaching should be ; but they may fairly
suorgrest the consideration whether it is not of the
utmost importance that our congregations should
be disabused of mistaken and false notions upon
that subject, and indoctrinated with sound ones.
We cannot suppose, without attributing to the
pulpit a superiority to human infirmity far greater
than it can lay claim to, that the taste and demand
of the people will not always greatly influence,
if not the substance of its teaching, at any rate
the form, manner and method of it—if not the tI
aKoverai, at any rate the ttw?. No doubt it will
be the pulpit itself that will, in the first instance,
create the popular taste and give direction to the
popular demand. An individual or a small set, the
nucleus, perhaps, of what grows into a party, will
strike out some kind of novelty, more or less
marked, and either for the better or for the worse. If
it * takes,' the example will be followed, until nearly
every pulpit in the communion will be more or less
affected by the influence. Any one who has care-
fully observed the preaching of the English Church
during no longer a period than the last half century,
must  see  that  the  changes  it  has gone through

have been scarcely less evident than those of ' the
fashions' them.^elves. The social habits and the
costume of the present decade are not more varied
from those of 1830 or 1850 than is the kind of
preaching which now commands the most general
approval from that wliich drew crowds from the
West End to Bishopsgate, when Bishop Blomfield
was Kector; or made St. Mary's at Oxford such a
centre of power,* when John Henry Newman de-
livered his Parochial Sermons there. The com-
parative desertion which is occasionally witnessed of
good preachers who were once attractive, and who
continue to preach as well as ever they did, though
partly attributable to the popular craving for novelty,
is not always wholly due to that cause. When it is
said of such an one that " his day is gone by," it often
means, not that everybody has heard all he has to
say, and that to continue "sitting under " him is to be
served only with erambe repetita ; but that his style
or method is no longer in vogue. He does not hit
the taste and fall in with the tone of the times. In
short, he is out of fashion.t To say, therefore, that
preaching will be greatly influenced in respect to its
style, and somewhat even in respect to its matter, by
the consideration of popular taste and demand, is not

necessarily to attribute to preacliers any feeling that
is blameworthy. St. Paul asks, " How shall they
hear without a preacher ? " * and the converse ques-
tion may also be put, "How shall one preach without
hearers ?" It is hardly enough for him to be satis-
fied that he is delivering, Sunday after Sunday,
sermons that will stand every test, literary, ortho-
doxal, and even spiritual, if Sunday after Sunday
his auditory dwindles away, and what remains of it
grows more and more listless and drowsy, turns
more and more glances at the gallery clock, or more
and more openly and discourteously draws out and
consults the tardy-moving watch. In fact, the
preacher will and must accommodate himself to some
extent to the liking of his hearers, and therefore it
is a matter of importance, as affecting the quality of
his sermons, that his hearers should bring to the
hearing a just estimate of what sermons ought to be,
and the faculty of distinguishing what is good and
wholesome in them from what is unprofitable, not
to say deleterious, even though it may be agreeable.
As a help towards forming such tastes and culti-
vating such faculties, a better acquaintance with " the
Classic Preachers of the English Church " seemed
likely to be of service. The idea was not at all that
those preachers should be held up as models for
imitation in the present day, but simply that the

study of them should be recommended and their ex-
cellences understood and appreciated. To produce in
the pulpit of the nineteenth century sermons which
Andrewes or Donne, Sanderson or Butler, South
or Barrow, might themselves be supposed to have
written, or rather which might pass for theirs with
persons who have some little acquaintance with their
writings, would be a feat of considerable literary
cleverness, but worse than useless for any purpose of
nineteenth-century preaching. Classic models are
studied, not for the purpose of enabling the artist or
the writer to produce works which shall resemble, or
even be of the same character with, those models,
but in order to imbue him with feelings, furnish him
with principles, and elicit, animate, and strengthen
for him perceptions which he may apply to the em-
bodiment of his own original ideas. By this means
he is trained to observe in the best way, that is, un-
consciously, those laws of art, every violation of which
detracts from the value of liis work, and all con-
formity to which is an enhancement of its excellence.
When Burnet recommends the clergy to fit them-
selves for their pulpit ministrations by "reading
Quintilian, and Tully's book of Oratory, and by
observing the spirit and method of Tully's Orations:
or if they can enter into Demosthenes," to use him
"as a much better pattern,"* no one supposes that he
* ' Pastoral Care,' c. ix.
INTEODUCTION. XVU
would have tliem attempt in their sermons a kind of
Christianised classicality of structure and language.
Similarly it must not be imagined that in seeking to
extend a knowledge of our greatest preachers, and to
awaken an interest in them, with a view to the more
complete efficiency of the pulpit of our own day, any
such foolish and futile notion was entertained as
that those preachers might be what we should call
copied with advantage. I should question the de-
sirableness of even modernising and adapting them
for present use ; not so much, however, for the reason
against using other men's sermons, which Burnet
gives, viz. lest it should " too evidently appear that
he " who does this " cannot be the author of his own
sermons," which would " make both him and them
lose much of their weight,"* as because every age
and almost every generation has its own peculiar
modes of thought as much as, or even more than,
of expression. Though the Gospel itself can never
be " another," t it admits of endless variety in the
manner in which it is presented and commended to ac-
ceptance, a variety which may be legitimately turned
to account, and ought to be turned to account, by
accommodating its preaching, of course within proper
limits, to the peculiar wants, tempers, tastes, and
other circumstances of each particular period, as well
as each particular country, church and congregation.

XVlll INTRODUCTION.
And as it was never contemplated tliat the
preachers treated of in this series should be held up
as patterns for direct imitation, so neitlier was it
that their faults and defects should be overlooked or
extenuated. On the contrary, it was quite expected
that nearly all of them would afford occasions for
pointing out blots, blemishes, and imperfections,
which might be scarcely less useful as warnings than
their excellences and beauties might be as guides.
The series is not meant as a contribution to Ensflish
hagiology ; and if it were, the Advocatus DiahoU
would have a perfect right to insist that virtues
should not be attempted to be magnified by the
suppression of truth with regard to anything that
deserved censure or that ought to qualify praise. The
Saints of the Universal Church are men about whose
errors, indeed whose sins, their inspired histories
make no secret; and it certainly was neither ne-
cessary nor advisable to proceed upon a different
principle in depicting these lesser liglits, particularly
when the purpose for which they were to be depicted
is borne in mind. To indicate, and even somewhat
to exaggerate, what is faulty in their preaching,
could scarcely weaken—it might even strengthen—
the effect of a fair statement of their title to the
rank they hold. That they should have achieved,
in spite of such drawbacks, the eminence accorded
to them by universal consent, might reasonably be
argued to be evidence of an extraordinary balance of

the highest merit, and might well challenge all the
attention and study which their greatest admirers
could desire to see devoted to them. The saintliness
of Wilson infusing itself into his homely common-
place, and lending a holy charm even to his poverty
of thought; the tenderness, the fervour and the
poetry of Donne reconciling us to his fancies, ex-
travagances and affectations; the deep thought and
adamantine reasoning of Butler compelling us to
find ample excuse for his severe and unevangelical
dryness; Barrow by his conscientious thoroughness,
his robust strength, and his solid weight, overcoming
our impatience of lengthiness and elaborate detail;
Beveridge by his "simplicity and godly sincerity,"
his intimacy with the Word of God and his admir-
able use of it, his Apostolical Churchmanship and
his deep piety, winning us to find in his prosaic
plainness, his diffuseness and his prolixity, little or
no hindrance to our assent to his warmest eulogists;
and South, by his masterful command of well-nigh
every art and resource of the consummate orator, his
energy, his boldness, his wit, his lucidity and bril-
liancy of language, overcoming the repugnance which
his fierce combativeness and deficient spirituality
might well excite—these all are examples of tran-
scendent excellence, establishing its claims by the
help of the very things which might well prove
incompatible with aught that could be acknowledged
as great excellence at all.
XX INTRODUCTION.
It must not be supposed that the attempt to
encourage the study of sermons which have taken
their place as classical in the literature of the Church,
is in any way influenced by a wish, either that a more
artificial and (as it were) literary style of preaching
sliould prevail, or tliat extempore preaching should
be discouraged. With regard to the latter, it may
be worth consideration whether there is not some
reason to apprehend that it threatens to become too
common; but its practice is not only not incom-
patible with diligent study of homiletic literature,
but requires it even more tlian ' preaching from
book.' Coleridge would seem to have been singularly
unfortunate in his experience of extempore preachers,
for, so far, at least, as the Church of England is
concerned, the case was hardly so bad about forty
years ago as he describes it to have been.* It is
certainly a good deal better now. At the same time,
his description must be acknowledged to represent
very  truly  the  state  of   things  which  extempore

preaching has a tendency to produce ; and hence the
greater the disposition to adopt that method, and
the greater the probability of its adoption becoming
general, the greater Avill be the need of such studies
as may control and regulate it, so that it may be for
edification and not for destruction.*
These are days of a teeming press, of cheap books,
of education becoming almost universal and con-
sequently of oral instruction becoming less and less
generally necessary. Nevertheless, that kind of in-
struction will always have a place in every depart-
ment of knowledge, and in that of sacred knowledge
it can never lose the rank assigned to it in the form
of preaching by the Divine appointment. It may,
indeed, fail to have its position duly recognised, its
proper function rightly understood, and adequate
use made of it as a means of grace. As in an early
age, so now, it may be driven or lowered from its
proper estate by an undue exaltation of ritual t on
the one hand, or on the other by the spread of a
critical and contemptuous intellectualism. But ap-
preciated or not, well and sufficiently used or not,
it will always be an office committed to the Church,
and a power intrusted to her, which lay her under
a vast and most solemn responsibility as to the
account which she is able to give of it. '' It was
the pulpit beyond anything  else that carried  the

Keformation througli" . . . and thus "achieved a
more extensive and a more lasting conquest than all
the armies of England ever did. The effect of a
victory by the vulgar force of war passes and is for-
gotten, whereas that of the pulpit at the Keforma-
tion endures to this day—will endure throughout
all time and in all eternity. Such capacity for good
has the pulpit. Again, it was the pulpit that awoke
the nation to the civil wars in the reign of Charles
beyond every other instrument. . . . The main
alarum—the primary spring—of all the movements
of the powerful party that eventually subverted
both throne and altar, was the London pulpit—the
London pulpit which received the watchword from
the stirring spirits of the rising government and
communicated the shock to all the pulpits within
the four seas. Such power had the pulpit for evil—
the latter instance answering my purpose as well as
the former; for it seems to demonstrate the energy
there is in the pulpit, at least, however applied;
and the consequent obligation there is upon us, who
have it in our own hands to make the most of such
an engine, and not allow it to go to sleep"*—to
which I will add, or deteriorate or fail to keep pace
with an advancing intelligence.

sistency with the main design of these Lectures of

those biographical and personal sketches and refer-
ences which are contained in all of them. These
were indispensable not only to the completeness and
truth of the delineations, but also to the production
of their intended effects. There is no branch of
oratory, scarcely any of literary composition, into
which the individual man ought to enter so much
as into preaching. The advocate may and often
must identify himself so completely with his cause
or his client as to make him put his own personality
aside altogether, and even seem to believe and
feel otherwise than he really does. The senator
deals with a class of questions which are generally
out of the sphere of his inner life—that life which
constitutes the true self. But this is the sphere
into which it is the first object of the true preacher
to make his way, and within which his preaching,
to be really effective, must live and move and
have its being. Unreal words—that is to say, words
which represent motives, beliefs, affections and
thoughts which are not truly those of him who utters
them—can never hold their ground and exercise
any strong and enduring influence in that sjohere.
It is only the true self of one man that can ever
bring itself into that close contact and communion
with the true self of another, by which it becomes
to that other as the channel or instrument of God's
renovating grace. This consideration, as it will
explain  much of the power, will also account for

much of the weakness of the preachers here recom-
mended for study, and of a multitude of others who
have exercised and do exercise the like office with
theirs. Above all, it will serve as an admonition to
us who have been called to that office, that we
make it our supreme endeavour and most earnest
prayer that we may ourselves be what we tell others
that God, theirs and ours, would have us be.

Against the wall of the south choh- aisle in the

few of the thousands who visit the church daily
observe or have an opportunity of observing, but
which, once seen, is not easily forgotten. It is the
long, gaunt, upright figure of a man, wrapped close
in a shroud, which is knotted at the head and feet,
and leaves only the face exposed—a face wan, worn,

almost ghastly, with the eyes closed as in death.
This figure is executed in white marble, and stands
on an urn of the same, as if it had just risen
therefrom. The whole is placed in a black niche,
which, by its contrast, enhances the death-like pale-
ness of the shrouded figure. Above the canopy is
an inscription recording that the man whose effigy
stands beneath, though his ashes are mingled with
western dust, looks towards Him whose name is the
Orient.*
This monumental figure is not less remarkable in
its history than in its aspect. It is the sole me-
morial which has survived from the ancient church
of St. Paul destroyed by the great fire. For
many generations it lay neglected in the crypt,
amidst mutilated fragments of other less fortunate
monuments of the past, till, three or four years
ago, it was rescued from its gloomy abode under-
ground and erected in its present position, cor-
responding, as nearly as circumstances allowed, to
the place which it occupied in the old Cathedral
before the fire.f    The canopy and inscription were

restored from an ancient eograving. In its history
and in its character alike this monument is a fit
emblem of him whom it figures; for it speaks of a
death, a resurrection, a saving as by fire. It is the
effigy of John Donne, who was Dean of St. Paul's
shortly before the outbreak of the Great Eebellion.
Moreover, it has a peculiar interest arising from
the circumstances under which it was erected in the
first instance. It was not such a memorial as Donne's
surviving friends might think suitable to commemo-
rate the deceased, but it was the very monument
which Donne himself designed as a true emblem of
his past life and his future hopes. His friend and
biographer relates* that, being urged to give di-
rections for his monument, he caused an urn to be
carved ; that he wrapped himself in a winding-sheet,
and stood thereupon " with his eyes shut and with so
much of the sheet turned aside as might show his
lean, pale, and death-like face, which was purposely
turned towards the East, from whence he expected
the second coming of his and our Saviour Jesus;"
that, in this posture, he had a picture of himself
taken, which " he caused to be set by his bedside,
where it continued, and became his hourly object till
his death;" and that from this picture the sculpture
was executed after his decease, the inscription having

CLASSIC  PEEACHEES :
been written by Donne himself. In its quaint aifec-
tation and in its appalling earnestness this monu-
ment recalls the very mind of the man himself.
John Donne was born in 1573, the year after the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew. He was the child of
Roman Catholic parents, and in their faith he was
brought up. At the age of eleven he went to Hart
Hall, Oxford ; at the age of fourteen, or thereabouts,
he was "transj)lanted" to Trinity College, Cambridge.
At neither University did he proceed to a degree,
for his friends had a conscientious objection to his
taking the required oath. He was still only in his
seventeenth year, when he commenced the study of
the law, and soon after he entered Lincoln's Inn.
Of his subsequent life for some years we catch only
glimpses here and there. He was a courtier and
an associate of nobles and statesmen. He numbered
among his friends and acquaintances nearly all the
most famous literary men of the day—Ben Jonson,
Francis Bacon, Sir Henry Wotton, Selden, Bishop
Hall, Bishop ]\Iontague, Bishop Andrewes, George
Herbert, Izaak Walton. He was a great traveller
and a great linguist, a diligent student, a man of wide
and varied accomplishments. His versatility is a
constant theme of admiration with those who knew
him.*    At the age of twenty he wrote poems which
* See Grosart's preface to
Donne's ' Poems,' ii. pp. xvi. sq.

with Shakespeare, speaks of his

his contemporaries regarded as masterpieces. His
fame as a poet was greater in his own age than
it has ever been since. During the last century,
which had no toleration for subtle conceits and
rugged rhythms, it was unduly depreciated ; but
now again it has emerged from its eclipse. No
quaintness of conception and no recklessness of
style and no harshness of metre can hide the true
poetic genius which flashes out from his nobler
pieces.
It has been said that God's heroes are made out
of broken lives. There is indeed vouclisafed to the
steady progressive growth of a career which has
known no abrupt transition, and in which the days
are " bound each to each by natural piety," a calm
wisdom, a clear insight, an impressive influence,
unattainable on any other terms ; but for the fire,
the passion, the impulsive energy which bears down
all opposition, we must not uncommonly look to
a dislocated life. This dislocation may be either
of two kinds. It may be a dislocation of theological
belief, like Luther's; or it may be a dislocation
of moral character, like Ignatius Loyola's and John
Bunyan's; the dislocation of the convert or the dis-
location of the penitent. Donne's, like Augustine's,
w^as both the one and the other.
He grew up to maturity, as we saw, a Roman
Catholic; but while still a young man, he began to
study the Eoman controversy, as he himself says,
6 CLASSIC  PREACHEES:
'' with no inordinate liaste nor precipitation in bind-
ing myself to any local religion." " I had a larger
work to do," he writes, " than many other men."
He tells us that in this investigation he " surveyed
and digested the whole body of divinity " relating to
the controversy ; and he calls God to witness, that he
'• proceeded therein with humility and difSdence in
himself," and with *' frequent prayer and equal and
indifferent affections." * As the result of this search
after truth, he joined the Anglican communion.
It seems to me that the influence of this change has
impressed itself, as it could hardly fail to do, on his
preaching. In saying this, I do not refer to the
purely controversial parts, where the fact must be
obvious. The remark applies to the general scope
and character of his sermons. Tliey owe their chief
ibrce to the intense earnestness with wdiich he
dwells on the atoning power of Christ's passion;
and I cannot doubt that, from the intellectual side,
his vividness and grasp of conception on this point
owed much to his study of the Roman controversy.
Of the other dislocation, the discontinuity of his
moral life, it is more painful to speak; but no study
of Donne as a preacher would be at all adequate
which failed to take account of this fact. His friend
Izaak Walton, in an elegy written a few days after
liis death, has incidentally compared him to the chief

penitent in tlie Gospel. Contrasting with tlae light
effusions of his earlier years the religious poems,
which he assigns to a later period, he asks:—
" Did his rich soul conceive
And in harmonious holy numbers weave
A crown of sacred sonnets, fit to adorn
A dying martyr's brow, or to be worn
On that blest head of Mary Magdalen
After she wiped Christ's feet, but not till then.
Did he—fit for such penitents as she
And he to use—leave us a Litany
Wiiich all devout men love ? " *
Of the fact I fear there can be little doubt that
at one time he had led an immoral life. It is indeed
most unjust to measure the self-accusations of the
deyout servant of God by the common standard of
human language. The holiest men are the most
exacting with themselves. Bitter cries of anguish—
almost of despair—will be wrung from the saint for
sins which would cost the worldlinsf not one moment
of sleeplessness and not one prick of remorse. There-
fore, if they had stood alone, we ought not to have
laid too great stress on those " tones of pain, thrills
of contrition, stingings of accusation, wails over
abiding stains and wounds, and passionate weeping,"
which, in the language of a recent writer,! are
discernible in Donne's letters and sermons. But
unhappily his shame is written across his extant
poems in letters of fire.    In some of these there are

profligacies which it were vain to excuse as purely
imaginative efforts of the poet, or unworthy con-
descensions to the base tastes of the age. We are
driven to the conclusion that they reflect—at least to
some extent-r-the sensuality of the man himself. Of
such an offence I can offer no palliation. I know no
crime more unpardonable in itself, or more fatal in
its consequences, than this of prostituting the highest
gifts of genius to a propaganda of vice and shame,
this of poisoning the wells of a nation's literature
and spreading moral death through generations yet
unborn.* Donne's penitence was intense; he did
all he could to retrieve the consequences of his sin.
But he could not undo his work, could not blot out
the printed page. *' In his penitential years," says
his biographer, " viewing some of those pieces that
had been loosely—God knows, too loosely—scattered
in his youth, he wished they had been abortive, or so
short-lived that his own eyes had witnessed their
funerals." t
But whatever may have been the sins of his youth
and early manhood, his married life shows him a
changed man. His clandestine union brought him
only sorrows and trials from a worldly point of view;
* It must be remembered
however, that Donne was not
in many cases responsible for
the publication of his poems.
They were   published for  the
most part after his death.

but Le was an affectionate and true husband, faith-
ful to his wife during her lifetime, and loyal to her
memory in a solitary widowhood of many years after
her death.
The comparison of Donne with the great African
father was too obvious to escape notice. It is
touched upon by his earliest critic, his contemporary
and biographer ; * and it is drawn out by one of
his latest. Of one of his religious poems the pre-
sent Archbishop of Dublin writes: *' It is the
genuine cry of one engaged in that most terrible of
all struggles, wherein, as we are winners or losers,
we have won all or lost all." Then, adverting to this
parallel, he adds; " There was in Donne the same
tumultuous youth, the same entanglement in youth-
ful lusts, the same conflict with these, and the same
final deliverance from them; and then the same
passionate and personal grasp of the central truths
of Christianity, linking itself, as this did, with all
that he had suffered and all that he had sinned,
and all through which, by God's grace, he had
victoriously struggled." t It is no marvel then to
find Donne himself quoting St. Augustine more
frequently than any of the fathers—this "sensible
and blessed father," this '^ tender blessed father,"
as he affectionately calls him.
The bearing of these facts on his preaching will

be evident. Tliis moral experience was the comple-
ment of his intellectual experience. It taught him
to feel and to absorb into himself, as the other
taught him to understand and to reason about, the
doctrine of Christ's atoning grace. What penitence,
what tears, what merits of his own could wash out
the stains \\\i\\ ^Yhich such a life as his was imbrued ?
It was therefore no pions platitude, no barren
truism, no phrase of conventional orthodoxy, but
the profound conviction of a sinful, sorrowing, for-
given, thanksgiving man, when he speaks of "the
sovereign balm of our souls, the blood of Christ
Jesus." * Hear now these lines, which he wrote in
his later years on a sick-bed, and which often after,
when "sung to the organ by the choristers of St.
Paul's," as he himself told a friend, " raised the
affections of his heart and quickened his graces of
zeal and gi'atitude."t
" Wilt Thou forgive that sin, tlirougli which I run,
And do run still, though still I do deplore ?
When Tliou hast done. Thou hast not done;
For I have more.
" Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I have won
Others to sin, and made my sin their door ?
Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun
A year or two, but wallow'd in a score ?
Wlien Thou hast done, Thou hast not done ;
For I have more.

Of Donne's romantic career it has been said, that
his life is more poetical than his poetry.| We might
without exaggeration adapt this epigram to his
preaching, and say that his life was a sermon more
eloquent than all his sermons.
If, then, I were asked to describe in few words the
secret of his power as a preacher, I should say that
it was the contrition and the thanksgiving of the
penitent acting upon the sensibility of the poet.§

12 CLASSIC   PREACHERS:
Donne remained a layman till his forty-second
year. He was j)ressed again and again by friends
wlio knew his gifts, to enter Holy Orders, but for
some years he hesitated. His hesitation was due
partly to an unwillingness to incur the suspicion
with his own conscience of being influenced by
motives of self-interest, but still more by the recol-
lection of his 2)ast life. He himself had long
repented of the sins of his youth, and " banished
them his affections : " but though forgiven by God,
they were not forgotten by men ; and he feared that
they might bring some censure on himself, or (worse)
some dishonour on his sacred calling, if he com-
plied.*
At length he yielded, after much delay, to the
repeated solicitations of the King himself. In the
year 1614 he was ordained; and seven years after-
wards he was promoted to the Deanery of St. Paul's,
which he held till his death. He died in the 59th
year of his age, having been sixteen years in orders.
As a layman he had been notably a poet; as a
clergyman he was before all things a preacher. He
'had remarkable gifts as an orator, and he used them
well. Henceforward preaching was the main business
of his life. After he had preached a sermon " he
never gave his eyes rest," we are told, " till he had
chosen  out  a  new  text,  and  that night cast  his

sermon into a form and his text into divisions, and
the next day he took himself to consult the fathers,
and so commit his meditations to his memory, which
was excellent."*    On the Saturday he gave himself
an entire holiday, so as to refresh body and mind,
''that he might be enabled to do the work of the
day  following  not  faintly,  but  with courage and
cheerfulness."    When  first  ordained,  he   shunned
preaching   before  town   congregations.    He  would
retire to some country church with a single friend,
and so try his wings.    His first sermon was preached
in the quiet village of Paddington.    But his fame
grew rapidly ; and he soon took his rank as the most
powerful preacher of his day in the English Church.
Others envied him and murmured, says an admirer,
that, having been called to the vineyard late in the
day, he received his penny with the first.j
More than a hundred and fifty of his sermons
are published. Some of them were preached at
Lincoln's Inn, where he held the Lectureship ; others
at St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, of which church he was
vicar; others at Whitehall, in his turn as Royal
Chaplain, or before the Court on special occasions ;
others, and these the most numerous, at St. Paul's.
Of this last class a few were delivered at the Cross,
by  special  appointment,  but  the majority within

the Catliedral, when year after year, according to
the rule wliich is still in force at St. Paul's, he
preaclied as Dean at the great festivals of the
Church, Christmas and Easter and Whitsunday, or
when lie expounded the Psalms assigned to liis pre-
bendal stall, or on various incidental occasions.
An eminent successor of Donne, the late Dean
Milman, finds it diiScult to " imagine, when he
surveys the massy folios of Donne's sermons—each
sermon spreads out over many pages—a vast con-
gregation in the Cathedral or at Paul's Cross,
listening not only with patience, but with absorbed
interest, with unflagging attention, even with delight
and rapture, to those interminable disquisitions."
... "It is astonishing to us," he adds, "that he
should hold a London congregation enthralled,
unwearied, unsatiated." *
And yet I do not think that the secret of his
domination is far to seek.
" Fervet immeususque ruit."
There is throughout an energy, a glow, an im-
petuosity, a force as of a torrent, wliich must have
swept his hearers onward despite themselves. This
rapidity of movement is his characteristic feature.
There are faults in abundance, but there is no flag-
ging from beginning to end. Even the least manage-
able subjects yield to his untiring energy.    Thus he

occupies himself largely with the minute interpre-
tation of Scriptural passages. This exegesis is very
difficult of treatment before a large and miscellaneous
congregation. But with Donne it is always interest-
ing. It may be subtle, wire-drawn, fanciful, at
times; but it is keen, eager, lively, never pedantic
or dull. So again, his sermons abound in quota-
tions from the fathers; and this burden of patristic
reference would have crushed any common man.
But here the quotations are epigrammatic in them-
selves; they are tersely rendered, they are vigor-
ously applied, and the reader is never wearied by
them. Donne is, I think, the most animated of the
great Anglican preachers.
I select two or three examples out of hundreds
which might be chosen, as exhibiting this eagerness
of style, lit up by the genius of a poet and heated
by the zeal of an evangelist.   Hear this, for instance:
" God's house is the house of prayer. It is His
court of requests. There He receives petitions;
there He gives orders upon them. And you come to
God in His house, as though you came to keejD Him
company, to sit down and talk with Him half an
hour; or you come as ambassadors, covered in His
presence, as though ye came from as great a Prince
as He. You meet below, and there make your
bargains for biting, for devouring usury, and then
you come up hither to prayers, and so make God
your broker.    You rob and spoil and eat His people
16 CLASSIC  PREACHERS:
as bread by extortion and bribery and deceitful
weights and measures and deluding oaths in buying
and selling, and then come hither, and so make God
your receiver and His house a den of thieves . . .
As if the Son of God were but the son of some lord
that had been your schoolfellow in your youth, and
so you continue a boldness to Him ever after; so
because you have been brought up with Christ from
your cradle and catechized in His name, His name
becomes less reverend unto you ; and Sanctum et ter-
rihile, holy and reverend, holy and terrible, should
His name be."*
Or this:
" In the earth, in the grave, there is no distinc-
tion. The angel that shall call us out of that dust
will not stand to survey who lies nailed, who in
a coffin, who in wood, who in lead, who in a fine,
who in a coarser sheet; in that one day of the
resurrection there is not a forenoon for lords to
rise first and an afternoon for meaner persons to rise
after. Christ was not whipped to save beggars, and
crowned with thorns to save kings: He died, He
suffered all, for all."t
Or hear this again, which was a favourite passage
with Coleridge:
'' Death comes equally to us all and makes us all
equal when it comes.    The ashes of an oak in the

chimney are no epitaph of that oak, to tell me how
hiij;h or how large that was: it tells me not what
flocks it sheltered while it stood, nor what men
it hurt when it fell. The dast of great persons'
graves is speechless too ; it says nothing, it dis-
tinguishes nothing. As soon the dust of a wretch
whom thou wouldst not, as of a prince whom tliou
couldst not, look upon, will trouble tliine eyes, if
the wind blow it thither : and when a whirlwind
hath blown the dust of the churchyard into the
church, and the man sweeps out the dust of the
church into the churchyard, who will undertake
to sift those dusts again, and to pronounce, * This
is the patrician, this is the noble flour; and this is
the yeomanly, this the plebeian bran? '" *
Or listen again to this most terrible passage of
all. I do not quote it from any sympathy with this
mode of appeal to the Christian conscience, but
merely as illustrating the appalling power of the
preacher when he puts out his strength.
'* It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God ; but to fall out of the hands of tlie living
God is a horror beyond our expression, beyond our
imagination."
" That God should let my soul fall out of His hand
into a bottomless pit, and roll an unremovable stone
upon it, and leave it to that which it finds there (and

never have more to do with it. That of that pro-
vidence of God, that studies the life of every weed
and worm and ant and spider and toad and viper,
there should never, never any beam flow out upon
me; that that God who looked upon me when I was
nothing, and called me when I was not, as though I
had been, out of the womb and depth of darkness,
will not look upon me now, when, though a miser-
able and a banished and a damned creature, yet I
am His creature still, and contribute something to
His glory, even in my damnation; that that God
\A'ho hath often looked upon me in my foulest un-
cleanness and when I had shut out the eye of the
day, the sun, and the eye of the night, the taper,
and the eyes of all the world, with curtains and
windows and doors, did yet see me, and see me in
mercy, by making me see that He saw me, and
sometimes brought me to a present remorse and (for
that time) to a forbearing of that sin, should so turn
Himself from me to His glorious saints and angels,
as that no saint nor angel nor Jesus Christ Himself
should ever pray Him to look towards me, never
remember Him that such a soul there is; that that
God who hath so often said to my soul Quare
morieris ? ' Why wilt thou die ?' and so often sworn
to my soul Vivit Dominus, ' As the Lord liveth, I would
not have thee die but live,' will neither let me die
DONNE. 19
nor let me live, but die an everlasting life and live
an everlasting death; that that God who when He
could not get into me by standing and knocking, by
His ordinary means of entering, by His word. His
mercies, hath applied His judgments, and hath shaked
the house, this body, with agues and palsies, and
set this house on fire with fevers and calentures,
and frighted the master of the house, my soul,
with horrors and heavy apprehensions, and so made
an entrance into me; that that God should frustrate
all His own purposes and practices upon me, and
leave me and cast me away, as though I had cost
Him nothing; that this God at last should let this
soul go away as a smoke, as a vapour, as a bubble,
and that then this soul cannot be a smoke, a vapour,
nor a bubble, but must lie in darkness as long as the

which is described by eye-witnesses as more elo-
quent than the words of others, and you will
cease to wonder at the thraldom in which he held
his audience. '^A preacher in earnest," writes
Walton, ^* weeping sometimes/or his auditory, some-
times ivitli them: always preaching to himself; like
an angel from a cloud but in none; carrying some,
as St. Paul was, to heaven in holy raptures, and en-
ticing others by a sacred art and courtship to amend
their lives: here picturing a vice so as to make it
ugly to those who practised it, and a virtue so as to
make it beloved even by those that loved it not. . ."*
Indeed we cannot doubt that he himselt* was alive
to that feehng, which he ascribes to the " blessed
fathers" when preaching, "a holy delight to be
heard, and to be heard with delight." t
Donne's sermons are not faultless models of pulpit
oratory. From this point of view they cannot be
studied as the sermons of the great French preachers
may be studied. Under the circumstances, this w^as
almost an impossibility. Preaching his hour's sermon
once or twice weekly, he had not time to arrange and
re-arrange, to prune, to polish, to elaborate. As it is,
we marvel at the profusion of learning, the rich-
ness of ideas and imagery, the abundance in all kinds,
poured out by a preacher who thus lived, as it were,

Moreover, the taste of the age for fantastic imagery,
for subtle disquisition, for affectations of language
and of thought, exercised a fascination over him.
Yet even here he is elevated above himself and his
time by his subject. There is still far too much of
that conceit of language, of that subtlety of associa-
tion, of that " sport with ideas," which has been con-
demned in his verse compositions; but, compared
with his poems, his sermons are freedom and sim-
plicity itself. And, whenever his theme rises, he
rises too; and then in the giant strength of an
earnest conviction he bursts these green withes which
a fantastic age has bound about him, as the thread
of tow snaps at the touch of fire. Nothing can be
more direct or more real than his eager, impetuous
eloquence, when he speaks of God, of redemption, of
heaven, of the sinfulness of human sin, of the bounti-
fulness of Divine Love.
At such moments he is quite the most modern of
our older Anglican divines. He speaks directly to
our time, because he speaks to all times. If it be
the special aim of the preacher to convince of sin
and of righteousness and of judgment, then Donne
deserves to be reckoned the first of our Classic
preachers. We may find elsewhere more skilful
arrangement, more careful oratory, more accurate
exegesis, more profuse illustration; but here is the
light which flashes and the fire which burns.
Donne's learning   was  enormous;   and  yet  his
22 CLASSIC  PREACHERS:
sermons probably owe more to his knowledge of men
than to his knowledge of books. The penitent is too
apt to shrink into the recluse. Donne never yielded
to this temptation. He himself thus rebukes the
mistaken extravagance of penitence: "When men
have lived long from God, they never think they
come near enough to Him, except they go beyond
Him." * No contrition was more intense than his;
but he did not think to prove its reality by cutting
himself off from the former interests and associations
of his life. He had been a man of the world before;
and he did not cease to be a man in the world now.
*' Beloved," he says—this term *' beloved " is his
favourite mode of address—" Beloved, salvation itself
being so often presented to us in the names of glory
and of joy, we cannot think that the way to that
glory is a sordid life affected here, an obscure, a
beggarly, a negligent abandoning of all ways of pre-
ferment or riches or estimation in this world, for
the glory of heaven shines down in these beams
hither. ... As God loves a cheerful giver, so He
loves a cheerful taker that takes hold of His mercies
and His comforts with a cheerful heart."! This
healthy, vigorous good sense is the more admirable
in Donne, because it is wedded to an intense and
passionate devotion.

examples of his lively imagination flashing out
in practical maxims and lighting up the common
things of life; as for instance, where he pictures
the general sense of insecurity on the death of Eliza-
beth : " Every one of you in the city were running
up and down like ants with their eggs bigger than
themselves, every man with his bags, to seek where
to hide them safely." * Or where he enforces the
necessity of watchfulness against minor tempta-
tions: "As men that rob houses thrust in a child
at the window, and he opens greater doors for
them, so lesser sins make way for greater." f Or
when he describes the little effect of preaching
on the heartless listener: " He hears but the logic
or the rhetoric or the ethic or the poetry of the
sermon, but the sermon of the sermon he hears
not." J Of such pithy sayings Donne's sermons
are an inexhaustible storehouse, in which I would
gladly linger; but I must hasten on to speak of one
other feature before drawing to a close. Irony is a
powerful instrument in the preacher's hands, if lie
knows how to wield it; otherwise it were better left
alone. The irony of Donne is piercing. Hear the
withering scorn which he pours on those who think
to condone sinful living by a posthumous bequest:
" We hide our sins in His house by hypocrisy all our
lives, and we hide them at our deaths, perchance.

with a hospital. And truly we had need do so; when
we have impoverished God in His children by our
extortions, and wounded Him and lamed Him in
them by our oppressions, we had need to provide God
an hospital."* Or hear this again, on the criticism
of sermons: " Because God calls preaching foolish-
ness, you take God at His word and think preaching
a thing under you. Hence it is that you take so
much liberty in censuring and comparing preacher
an'l preacher." t And lastly, observe the profound
pathos and awe which is veiled under the apparent
recklessness of these daring words: " At how cheap
a price was Christ tumbled up and down in this
world! It does almost take off our pious scorn of
the low price at which Judas sold Him, to consider
that His Father sold Him to the world for nothing."!
For preaching Donne lived ; and in preaching he
died. He rose from a sick bed and came to London
to take his customary sermon at Whitehall on the
first Friday in Lent. Those who saw him in the
pulpit, says Walton quaintly,§ must " have asked
that question in Ezekiel, ' Do these bones live ?'"
The sermon was felt to be the swan's dying strain.
Death was written in his wan and wasted features,
and spoke through his faint and hollow voice.
The subject was in harmony with the circum-
stances.    He took as his text the passage in the

Psalms, " Unto God the Lord belong the issues of
death." His hearers said at the time that " Dr.
Donne had preached his own funeral sermon."
The sermon is published. It betrays in part a
diminution of his wonted fire and animation. We
seem to see the preacher struggling painfully with
his malady. But yet it is remarkable. The theme
and the circumstances alike invest it with a peculiar
solemnity; and there are flashes of the poet-preacher
still.
" This whole world," he says, " is but a universal
churchyard, but one common grave: and the life
and motion that the greatest persons have in it is
but as the shaking of buried bodies in their graves
by an earthquake."*
" The worm is spread under thee, and the worm
covers thee. There is the mats and carpet that lie
under, and there is the state and the canopy that
hangs over the greatest of the sons of meD."t
" The tree lies as it falls, it is true, but yet it is
not the last stroke that fells the tree, nor the last
word nor the last gasp that qualifies the man."f
Hear novv the closing words, and you will not be
at a loss to conceive the profound impression which
they must have left on his hearers, as the dying
utterance of a dying man.
" There we leave you in that blessed dependency,

down in peace in His grave, till He vouchsafes you
a resurrection and an ascension into tliat kingdom
which He hath purchased for you with the ines-
timable price of His incorruptible blood.    Amen."
Amen it was. He had prayed that he might die
in the pulpit, or (if not this) that he might die of
the pulpit; and his prayer was granted. From this
sickness he never recovered; the effort hastened his
dissolution; and, after lingering on a few weeks, he
died on the last day of March, 1631.
This study of Donne as a preacher will be fitly
closed with the last stanza from his poem entitled,
* Hymn to God, my God, in my sickness,' which
sums up the broad lesson of his life and teaching.
" So in His purple wrapped, receive me, Lord;

The idee, of a special appeal once a year for all the
Hospitals is, in substance at all events, some cen-
turies old. In some fields near Bethnal Green
there existed in old times a Priory and Hospital,
* Hospital Sunday, June 17, 1877.
28 CLASSIC   PKEACHEES:
dedicated to the honour of our Lord and the Virgin
Mary, and commonly called  St. Mary Spital.    In
the cliurchyard  of the Priory, now Spital Square,
was in old times a pulpit-cross, something like that
which was once in St. Paul's Churchyard; and here
originally were preached every year what were known
as the Spital, or Hospital, Sermons.    It is said to
have   been * for  a long  time   a custom  on  Good
Friday, in the afternoon, for some learned man, by
appointment of the Prelates, to  preach  a  sermon
at Paul's Cross, treating of Christ's passion.     On
the three next Easter holydays, other learned men,
by a like appointment, used to preach in the after-
noon at the said Spital on the Article of Christ's
resurrection ; and then on the Sunday after Easter,
before noon, another learned  man at Paul's Cross
was to make rehearsal of these four sermons, either
commending   or   reproving,   as   was  thought   con-
venient;  and he was then to make a sermon him-
self, which in  all  were  five   sermons  in  one.    At
all these sermons the Lord Mayor, with his brethren
the aldermen, were accustomed to be present.    The
pulpit was broken  down in the  Grand Rebellion,
but the sermons were continued, with the old name
of the Spital Sermons, at St. Bride's and elsewhere,
and they retained some associations connected with
the old Hospital.    la 1740 we have Bishop Butler

preachiDg one of them, and the institutions for
which he preached are specified as Christ's Hospital,
for children; St. Bartholomew's and St. Thomas's
Hospitals, for the wounded, maimed, sick, and dis-
eased ; Bridewell, for the vagrant and other indigent
and miserable people; Bethlehem, for distracted
men and women; and the London Workhouse in
Bishopsgate Street. The word Hospital was used
in the width of its old signification, but to all intents
and purposes this was a Hospital day.
It seems a pity, if such a suggestion may be per-
mitted, that the new institution of Hospital Sunday
has not beeu affiliated on this old custom. But to
pass to my other subject. On Wednesday, in Easter
week, in the year 1671, a very remarkable sermon
was preached at the Spital, " On the Duty and
Keward of Bounty to the Poor." There is a tra-
dition that it occupied three hours and a half in de-
livery ; but since the Court of Aldermen desired the
Preacher to print his sermon, " with what farther he
had prepared to deliver at that time;" and since the
sermon as now printed occupies not more than ninety-
four octavo pages, it is thought there may be some
exaggeration in this tradition. The Preacher is said
to have begun to be weary with standing so long;
but it is not recorded that there was any weariness
on the part of the audience. On the contrary, as we
have seen, having heard a good deal, they desired
to  read   more;   and   no  wonder,  for the  sermon
30 CLASSIC  PEEACHERS:
is almost an exhaustive treatise on the subject.
It is on the text, *'He hath dispersed, he hath
given to tlie poor, his righteousness endureth for
ever, his horn shall be exalted with honour."
After some observations on the comprehensiveness
of the liberality thus described, the preacher goes
on, as he says, to propound several considerations
" whereby the plain reasonableness, the great weight,
the high worth and excellency of this duty, together
with its strict connection with other principal
duties of piety, will appear." *
First, he observes that there is no sort of duty more
expressly commanded in Scripture, so much so that
risrhteousness and mercifulness are almost inter-
changeable terms; Charity, in fact, being the main
point of religion, and mercy and bounty the chief
parts of Charity. He proceeds to discuss the obliga-
tions to this virtue arising from our relation to God,
from our relation to the poor themselves, from the cha-
racter and origin of wealth, and the relative positions
of the rich and the poor. It is characteristic of him
that, preaching to a rich audience, himself a staunch
Cavalier and a champion of established order, he does
not hesitate to declare that, in the existing degree, the
differences of wealth and poverty are not natural. It
was sin, he exclaims, which " begot these ingrossings

and enclosures of things; it forged those two small
pestilent words, meum and tiium,'' and we are bound in
some measure to redress the balance thus disturbed.
But so far as the distinctions of rich and poor are
divinely appointed, it is in order that a charitable
intercourse of mutual gratitude and obligation should
be established between them. The poor, moreover,
have the special distinction of representing the form
assumed by our Saviour Himself. " The greatest
princes and potentates in the world," exclaims the
Preacher, " the most wealthy and haughty of us all,
but for one poor beggar had been irrecoverably
miserable;" and "if we will do poverty right, we
must rather for His dear salve and memory defer
an especial respect and veneration thereto." All
these points are elaborated in detail, and vigorously
enforced with quotations and illustrations. The
Preacher pursues every excuse for uncharitableness
into its hiding-place, and drags them forth one by
one. A Christian, in a word, is one who has pledged
himself to imitate the benign and charitable Son
of God, and " a Christian niggard plainly is no
Christian, but a blemish, a reproach, and a scandal
to that honourable name." Finally, he quotes ex-
amples of liberality, not omitting that of the City
of London itself, and briefly recounts the honours
which the text attaches to bountifulness.
Such a recital of the obligations, the reasons, and
the blessings of Charity oi^jht not to be without its

effect on our liberality this afternoon; and, at all
events, it may afford some idea of one of the chief
characteristics of the Preacher in question. But
before dwelling on these characteristics, let us en-
deavour to realise the man himself. He was a man
who, in several respects, ought to command especial
interest at this time. Though this was the first
sermon he ever printed, and he was but forty years
of age, he had long held a very distinguished position
at Cambridge and was one of the King's Chaplains.
Twenty-five years before he had entered Trinity
College, Cambridge, and ever since theu, with
the sole interval of a year or two spent in
travel, Cambridge had been his home. During
that time he had devoted himself with astonishing
industry, vigour, and success to almost every study
which the University offered. The period was the
very turning-point in the history of that great
University. Within the space of Dr. Barrow's
career—for that was the name of the Preacher—
had that bent been given to it which has since
rendered it in a peculiar degree the home of the
mathematical and physical sciences. It was just
at this moment, in the middle of the seventeenth
century, that the new experimental philosophy, to
which Lord Bacon, himself a Cambridge man, had
given so momentous an impulse, began decisively to
assert its predominance. When Barrow entered Cam-
bridge, no branch of philosophical science  except
BAKROW. 33
Medicine was represented by a Professor; there was
only one lecture in Mathematics, and these were
so eleiDentary that Barrow describes it as a great
achievement " that men had ceased to tremble at
the name of Euclid, and had even triumphed over
the mysteries of Algebra." But in 1663 the Lu-
casian Professorship of Mathematics was founded.
Barrow became the first Professor; and one year
before he preached this Spital Sermon he had
resigned this Professorship, and had been succeeded
by one of his own pupils, whose nams was Isaac
Newton. During the time he held the Professor-
ship he had approached to the very verge of one of
Newton's greatest mathematical discoveries; and had
he given his life to the subject, the master might
have been only second to the pupil. But Barrow's
energy could not be confined to one subject. Three
years before his appointment to the Mathematical
Chair he had been elected to the Professorship of
Greek ; and he was confessedly one of the first
Greek and, Latin scholars of the day. But this was
far from all. He was intensely interested in the
rising experimental sciences, and studied with great
success anatomy, botany and chemistry. Had he
been unbiassed, he might even have made Medicine
his profession, but he held one of those preferments,
so obnoxious to modern ideas, now known as clerical
fellowships; and on the eve of their probable aboli-
tion let it be remembered to their  credit that, in

tins instance at least, if they spoilt a great matlie-
raaticiau or natural philosopher, they did at least
foster a great divine.
Barrow felt that his oath bound him to make
Divinity the end of his studies. It would seem that
about the time his Spital Sermon was preached, he
had finally devoted himself to this career ; and in
the following year Charles II. appointed him to the
Mastership of Trinity College, saying that he gave
it to the best scholar in England. He held the post
only five years, dying in 1677, in his forty-seventh
year, after preaching the only other Sermon which
he lived to prepare for publication, that delivered
at the Gnildhall on Good Friday, 1077, on the
Passion of our Blessed Saviour. One or two more
touches will complete his portraiture sufficiently for
our purpose. He was the son of a wealthy citizen,
who suffered much for his adherence to the cause of
the King; and when the authority of the Church
and the King was supplanted at Cambridge by
Parliamentary Commissioners, Barrow distinguished
himself as an undergraduate by his bold, though
not obtrusive, adherence to the old cause. As a boy
at the Charterhouse he was chiefly distinguished
by his pugnacity; but as the troubles of the time
began, he settled down to serious and diligent study.
Lastly, as another point which should command
attention for him at the present moment, during his
travels he spent a year at Constantinople, and he

has left an account of the Turks and their religion,
in prose * and verse,t which has been recently said
to afford, even now, the best short account of the
subject existing.^ Unfortunately both these pieces
are in Latin; but could I trouble you with a
quotation, § you would see that his impressions of
the Turks and their religion do not differ much from
those which are most current at this hour.
Such, however, was the man who, in a Spital
Sermon of the year 1671, poured on the heads of
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of
London that flood of discussion, exhortation, denun-
ciation, argument, encouragement, which I just now
described. There is, perhaps, something in it which
recalls the early character of the boy. There is a
certain pugnacity about tlie form of the argument
which suggests that the old spirit was still alive in
him. Throughout the Sermon he seems to have
before him the character whom he describes as " the
Christian niggard;" and he appears to take a de-
light in demolishing this monster with as many and
as vigorous blows as his own strecgth and the en-

durance of bis audience will allow him to inflict.
Almost all his sermons are marked by something
of this combative character—a disposition fostered
probably by the fierce and fiery temper of the
times in which he had been trained. It assumes,
how^ever, no mere contentious form, but passes into
a noble and burning indignation against vices, weak-
nesses, follies, and stupidities of all kinds. It may
be owned, perhaps, he makes sometimes too little
difference between these several sources of human
error; and few things seem more to vex his soul
than the perverseness and stupidity of mankind.
His own nature is so vigorous, healthy, and well
balanced, that he can make little allowance for
feebler souls. Whatever he touches becomes as
clear and definite to him as the mathematical
problems he had worked out with Isaac ISTewton.
Every sermon is like the demonstration of a
theorem. It seems to conclude with a quod erat
probandum, " which was to be proved," and to
develop into a problem, quod est faciendum,
"which must be done." There is no escaping
from this vigorous athlete, this master of the whole
science of logical and rhetorical attack and defence.
He pursues his antagonist into every corner of
the ground, allows him, with the utmost fairness,
to avail himself of all conceivable defences, and
breaks them all down, one after the other, with

numerous blows. He has no idea of giving quarter
in intellectual warfare. We are concerned with him
mainly as a Preacher, and his treatise, therefore, on
the Pope's Supremacy * can only be referred to by
way of illustration. But it is the finest example of
this " ability to contend/' as Bacon calls it, to be found
in his works; and judging by what is daily passing
around us, it is not soon likely to become obsolete.
He shows that the Pope's plea of Supremacy involves
at least seven distinct suppositions :—that St. Peter,
by our Lord's appointment, had a primacy over the
Apostles; that this primacy was not personal but
derivable to his successors; that St. Peter was Bishop
of Bome, and that he continued so till his decease;
that the Bishops of Rome by Divine institution have
a universal supremacy and jurisdiction over the
Church; that, in fact, since St. Peter's time, they
have continually enjoyed and exercised this power;
and lastly, that it is indefectible and unchangeable.
The mere statement of this chain of suppositions is
in itself a crushing argument; but Barrow pursues
each one of them into all its ramifications with the
utmost vigour and vehemence and with the most
ample learning, until the field within the limit of his
survey seems completely cleared of hostile forces.
The same method, in varying degrees, is constantly
reflected in his sermons, and he emerges from every

one of them a victor over some form of sin or error
with which he has been in mortal combat.
But Ave should do him great injustice, as my
sketch of his Spital Sermon will, I hope, have
shown, if we regarded this as more than his first
aspect as a preacher. This, if I may so express it,
is in great measure the natural man, and in the
preacher we have the man of grace and of piety
overpowering it, and moulding natural tendencies to
loftier purposes. In the first place, that minuteness
of detail, that exhaustiveness, as Charles II. cha-
racterised it, into which his dialectical habits led
him, produced a new and more gracious effect when
applied to the illustration of moral and spiritual truth.
There are two great types of mind, with two distinct
methods of dealing with such subjects. The one
seizes some great truth, which it kindles into a new
illumination, and then leaves all the details of fact
and theory to be discerned by this central light.
The other goes through these details themselves,
examines them one by one, and gradually builds up
with them a harmonious whole. Barrow's mind is
of the latter cast. Every sermon, like the one I
have analysed, is exhaustive in the sense of being
a comprehensive discussion of all the component
parts of his subject. He goes through them all,
one by one, step by step, and places each in
its right position. The process, it must be owned,
is sometimes tedious, but  it must also be allowed
BAKEOW. 39
that the result in the hands of a strong and
laborious workman like Barrow is vastly impres-
sive. When the quarry is exhausted, and all
the stones are in their appointed places, we have
a massive and a solid edifice before us, com-
plete from its foundations to its roof, and strongly
compacted in every part. The essential merit of
this process consists in the completeness and ex-
haustiveness with which it is carried into effect, and
with Barrow the workmanship is in this respect of
the very highest excellence.
There are occasions, indeed, when such a method
necessarily fails. It is hard to imagine an audience,
even in former days, really listening to even one
half of the full development of the argument of
the Spital Sermon. Yet to any one who will have
the patience to peruse the discourse as a whole, and
to contemplate it as a whole, it has a force whit-h
could hardly be otherwise exerted. It is when
we see that a virtue like that of bountifulness
has all these various bearings — how it touches
our relations to God, to our neighbour, to the
poor, to ourselves, to our peace of mind and to
our welfare here and hereafter—it is only when
we contemplate a virtue in all this manifold
extent of its operations that we can be fully
impressed by all its practical importance. Barrow
loves to dwell on details, not as details, but as
essential to the full production of the total effect.
40 CLASSIC preachers:
" In sucli manner," for instance, he says in one place,*
"ought we diligently to survey and. judiciously to
estimate the effects of Divine beneficence, examin-
ing every part, and descanting upon every circum-
stance thereof: like those that contemplate some
rare beauty, or some excellent picture; some com-
mending the exact proportions, some the graceful
features, some the lively colours discernible therein."
In this manner, as you will have observed,
does Barrow in his Spital Sermon, and in many
others, fill up all the lights and shades, and
depict all the varying colours of the subject he is
portraying; until bit by bit, under his patient
and steady hand, its great and impressive unity
overshadows us. Sometimes, indeed, as we have
seen, he goes far beyond the reach of the powers
of attention in modern congregations; yet it must
also, I think, be allowed that, when this method
is kept within reasonable limits, we ought not to
be so impatient of it as we are in these days
apt to be. In every other form of formal public
lecture we not only tolerate, but we even demand a
length which would not be incompatible with the
delivery of many among Barrow's Sermons. If
some law of Nature is to be expounded at the Eoyal
Institution, nobody complains that the Lecturer
occupies the better part of an hour; and the laws
and  relations  of  our  moral nature  are  certainly

not less intricate, nor less various, than those of the
physical world. Barrow, one might sometimes think,
carries into his theological and moral demonstrations
something of the character of tlie experimental philo-
sopher. He is laying bare all the consequences and
the connections of moral laws; and he has a right
to demand some patience from his audience. At all
events, if they give it, they are abundantly repaid;
and if from such a discourse as the Spital Sermon a
man is simply impressed with the complexity, the
intricacy, the multitude and the magnitude of moral
and spiritual influences, in that impression alone he
has acquired a conviction which it would be difficult
otherwise to convey to him.
Such were Barrow's methods. But as with all
really able men, they were strictly subordinated to his
objects ; and what, let us next a^k, were the purposes
to which this strong, clear-sighted, and vehement
mind, stored with all the old and all the new learning,
devoted itself in the full force of its manhood ? To
appreciate the answer to that question, it is necessary
to bear in mind the circumstances of the nation at
the time when Barrow, under a sense of duty, devoted
himself to theology. He himself, in a sermon on the
King's happy return,* preached, however, sixteen
years after that event, gives a melancholy description
of his times—how, "from dissensions in opinion,
violent factions and feuds were raging, the hearts of

and mean\\hile "the world about us in combustion,
cruel wars raging everywhere, and Christendom
weltering in blood." It must be owned this is hardly
an overdrawn description of the position of a great
part of English society and of the world at large in
the reign of Charles II., towards the days of the
Popish Plot, amidst the wars of Louis XIV., and
when we ourselves seemed drifting towards another
religious and civil war. Remembering that all these
disturbances and confusions, and above all the civil
strife which had stained the country with blood, had
been set on foot in the name of religion, often in
the name of some exclusive theological theory, and
that different sects had torn the country to pieces
for the sake of schemes of ecclesiastical discipline,
it was not wonderful if for the moment a strong tide
seemed to set towards distrust of all religion, reck-
lessness of morals, and mere selfishness.

But Barrow had been brought up under sober and
religious influences, and throughout his life at the
University he exhibited a singular steadiness of pious
and conscientious convictions. We have no means
of tracing the full course of his thoughts, but from
the moment that he comes before us, we find him
possessed with a deep and settled persuasion that
in the great and broad truths of religion lie the
foundations of morality, while in morality lie the
foundations of individual and national welfare. He
sets himself, accordingly, with all the strength of one
of the most resolute natures, to bring these cardinal
principles home to the men of his day, and to
vindicate once more the simple and practical, but
none the less potent, influence inherent in the great
elementary truths of the Christian religion. He
leaves on one side, or brushes away, the thorny con-
troversies with which religion has been overlaid: he
can hardly speak respectfully of even the grand
controversy of the Eeformation respecting justification
by faith; and he goes straight to the broad facts of
Christian belief and moral duty. He starts, indeed,
with the most vivid and overpowering realisation
of God. The Divine Being is not to him a mere
theological principle assumed on grounds of science,
or believed on mere authority. God, in his own
words, is '' the most intelligible object" of our minds,
meaning that "we are capable of knowing more,
more clearly, more assuredly of God than of any
44 CLASSIC preachers:
other, yea, than of all other things."* These are not
careless expressions. He supports theui in one of
his finest arguments, in a sermon entitled,! "An
adequate knowledge of God attainable by man."
Of other objects, he says, we can perceive very little,
"only some faint colours, some superficial shapes,
some dull objects; while their intrinsic nature, their
chief radical properties remain enclosed and debarred
from our sight in an inaccessible darkness. But of
God w^e may apprehend (in some degree according
to our uatural capacity) His most essential attri-
butes ; ra /j^eyaXela 7ov (deov, His (magnificences)
great things; His infinite goodness, wisdom and
power." " We cannot," he exclaims, " without shut-
ting our eyes, exclude that light of Divine glory
which fills and illustrates the world; without stopping
our ears we cannot but hear that universal shout
(that real harmony of the spheres) which all creatures
in heaven and earth consent in utterance to his
praise." He proceeds to illustrate this idea in a
magnificent image, which could only have occurred
to a great theologian who was also a real man of
science. " What the sun is," he says, "in the visible
world, most visible himself, and imparting visibility
to all other things," so is God in the intelligible
world ; " and as whatever we behold with our bodily
eyes, 'tis not so much the thing itself which we see,
* ' Works,' vol. iv. pp. 477-8        t Ibid., vol. iv. pp. 461-491,

as an emanation from the sun; an imperfect image,
as it were, of him reflected from the specular surface
of some body, in itself opaque and invisible; a
mere draught of the sun; stained by the colours
and fashioned by the shape of that body; so is God
in the world of things intelligible: most brightly
radiant to our intellectual eyes; (lie is light, and
hi Kim there is no hind of darkness), He is Himself
most intelligible, and communicates intelligibility
to all other things : With Thee, saith David, is the
fountain of life; in Thy light shall ive see light. 'Tis
by His light that all things are illuminated; every
creature is, as it were, sj^ecuhim Dei; whatever we
discern in them is but some indirect glimpse of His
light, some faint shadow of His power and perfection :
and in this sense, Jupiter est quodcunque vides^
Barrow does not often rise to this height, nor
indeed, does any one else ; but this faith in God,
almost amounting to an abiding vision, is combined
in Barrow's mind with a conviction, all the more
deep and important because apparently spontaneous
and natural to him, that our point of contact with
the Divine nature is to be found in the pursuit of
all truth, no matter of what kind, but above all
in the truth of the conscience and in the everyday
duties of morality. " Truth," he says, " is the natural
food of our soul, towards which it hath a greedy
appetite;" and all knowledge, accordingly, all the
sciences of which he was such a master, are claimed
46 CLASSIC  PREACHERS :
by liim as the soul's fitting endowments. But it is
in moral truth that he sees the most immediate
participation of the Divine nature. In more than
one place he uses the term "conscience" as practically
equivalent to religion or godliness; and in number-
less places he expresses the main object of religion
to be the encouragement and restoration among us
of the ordinary vii-tues of morality. Omitting many
passages, it will be sufficient to quote one which
brings into strong contrast the character of the reli-
gion for which he was contending and that which
had brought so much misery on the nation. "Re-
ligion," he says, in one of liis early University
Sermons,* " consisteth not in fair profession and
glorious pretences, but in real practice; not in a
pretentious adherence to any sect or party, but in a
sincere love of goodness, and dislike of naughtiness,
wherever discovering itself . . . not in a nice ortho-
doxy . . . but in a sincere love of truth, in a hearty
approbation of, and compliance with, the doctrines
fundamentally good, and necessary to be believed ;
not in harsh censuring and virulently inveighing
against others, but in carefully amending our own
ways; . . . not in a furious zeal for or against trivial
circumstances, but in a conscionable practising the
substantial parts of religion ... in a word, Religion
consists in nothing else but doing what becomes our

relation to God, in a conformity or similitude to His
nature, and in a willing obedience to His holy will."
" It was the design of Divine goodness," as he else-
where expresses himself, " in sending onr Saviour, to
render us good and happy, to deliver us from sin and
misery, to instruct us in the knowledge, and to habi-
tuate us to the practice of all virtue, and thereby to
qualify us for tlie enjoyment of a blessed immor-
tality."
Such are the grand though simple objects which
Barrow, from the first, has in view; and accordingly
the vast majority of his sermons are devoted to the
illumination of daily duty by the light of the Chris-
tian religion and of the Scriptures. They are on such
subjects as the "Pleasantness of Eeligion;" "The
l^rofitableness of Godliness;" " Upright Walking
Sure Walking;" "The Duty of Prayer and of
Thanksgiving ;" " Not to Offend in Word ; "
" Against Foolish Talking and Jesting ; " " Of Kash
and Vain Swearing;" "Against Evil Speaking in
general;" against "The Folly of Slander;" "Of
Quietness, and Doing our own Business;" " Of
being Imitators of Christ;" "Of Submission to
the Divine Will," " Of Contentment;" " Of Industry
in General, and in our Particular Calling;" " Of
-Obedience;" of "Providing things Honest in the
Sight of all Men." But he always endeavours to
lay the foundation of his argument in the great
truths of the Gospel, and there are several Sermons
48 CLASSIC preachers:
specially devoted to these. Above all, there is
a series of " Sermons on the Creed," * of which the
character, as distinguished from the great work of
his contemporary, Pearson, is that he dwells on
the vital and operative, rather than on the formal
and scientific, side of our faith. When vindicating,
for instance, our Saviour's Messiahship, he dwells
with especial force, and with devout detail, on the
supreme moral excellence of His character and His
life. In short, Barrow is at once the most convinced
of theologians and the most earnest of moralists;
and he throws his whole energy into the task of
reinforcing religion by morality and morality by
religion. He does not, indeed, except in a few
remarkable instances, such as I have quoted, deal
with the philosophical aspect of the great truths of
the Christian faith; nor is he even much concerned
with the deeper moral problems of human nature.
The sense of sin, with the profound questionings it
aroused in the minds of men like Augustine, Luther,
or even Bunyan, is not in, any similar degree the
motive power of his theology. His nature seems,
perhaps, too sound and vigorous to have been en-
tangled in the inward struggle to which the c* m-
bined weakness and strength of an Augustine gave
rise. He regarded Christianity, in fact, rather as the
necessary condition of a sound and healthy human
' Works,' vols, v., vi., vii.
BAEROW. 49
nature than as the remedy of a diseased one. It
seems to his mind part of the essential constitution
of things, and he inculcated it as the primary law of
existence.
Such was the work of Barrow, and he did it suc-
cessfully. He accomplished it, moreover, by no
other means than by a mauly appeal to the reason,
the good sense, and the good feeling of the men of
his day. He refused to address his appeal to any
lower Court than that of a reasonable and en-
lightened conscience. " God," he says, *' neither doth
nor can enjoin us faith without reason ; but therefore
doth require it as matter of duty from us, because
he hath furnished sufficient reason to persuade us."
Indeed, it is one of his most essential characteristics
that he is almost unable to conceive of a man acting
under any other motive than a firm intellectual
persuasion. " If we do seriously weigh the case," he
says,* " we shall find, that to require faith without
reason is to demand an impossibility; for faith is
an effect of persuasion, and persuasion is nothing
else but the application of some reason to the mind,
apt to draw forth its assent. No man, therefore,
can believe he knoweth not what or why; he that
truly believeth must apprehend the proposition, and
he must discern its connection ^ith some principle
of truth, which as more notorious to him he before

dotli admit; otherwise he doth only pretend to
believe, out of some design, or from affection to some
party; his faith is not so much really faith, as
hypocrisy, craft, fondness, or faction." There is, it
must be allowed, too much rigidity in this defini-
tion ; it makes too little allowance for the appeal of
faith to those instincts of the heart which lie deeper
than the intellect, and at the same time are nearer
the surface of human natnre. For instance, it pre-
vents Barrow apprehending, as has been already
observed, the depth and importance of the great
controversy of the early years of the Eeforma-
tion respecting faith. But if this be an error, it
is at all events one which his conntrymen would
be very ready to excuse, and which was, perhaps,
especially welcome after the deluge of irrational en-
thusiasm with which the country had been flooded.
It is at least an error on the manly side; and
it requires, perhaps, an intrepidity like that of
Barrow—the same kind of daring with which, on
his voyage to Constantinople, he fought one of
the guns of his ship against an Algerine pirate—
to be thus prepared, as it were, to stake the whole
success of our cause on the superiority of the
intellectual batteries we can bring into action.
But Englishmen love a good fighter; and as long
as men admire manly appeals to reason, free from
the slightest touch of affectation, so long will Barrow
demand  the attention,  and extort  the respect, of
BAKEOW. 51
every   one   who   is   competent  to   enter   into  the
Christian controversy.
Accordingly, though there may have been, per-
haps, in the English Church, profounder or more
subtle theologians, more eloquent or more polished
Preachers, there has been no one who has exhibited
more forcibly the harmony of the Christian faith
with the moral convictions, the scientific progress,
and the solid learning of Englishmen. Barrow
emeri^fes from amidst the confusion of his time like a
well-armed champion, trained in every moral and in-
tellectual exercise, the representative alike of the old
and the new learning, of classical culture, of experi-
mental philosophy, and above all of Christian belief,
and he challenges all the forces of anarchy to break
the bonds which unite these influences. May we not
all in these days learn something from his manliness
and his faith ? He has had, indeed, his successors
in every age, though none perhaps of quite so
vigorous, so sound, and so intrepid a nature. But
we, like him, are surrounded by the brilliant dawn of
what is almost a new experimental philosophy; we,
like him, witness the very name of religion dis-
graced all around us by what he called " furious zeal
for and against trivial circumstances," and some-
times by miserable perversions of its truths and
ordinances. Like him, we see men recoiling from
these scandals and acquiescing in infidelity or scep-
ticism ; like him, too, we see the political forces of

THE   RHETOEICIAN.
Peculiar character of the age in which South lived, owing to
the various schools of thought which were beginning to show
themselves in the Church of England—This character due to
the genius of the English Reformation, which had encouraged
greater freedom of thought, and greater love of antiquity, than
existed in any other of the Reformed Churches—Consequent
certainty of a struggle between these oi^posing elements, which
actually took place under Charles I. and Charles II.
Sketch of the life of Soutli—His education at Westminster and
at Oxford—His early indications of great ability, and of strong
antipathy to the Puritans—Is made Chaplain to Lord Clarendon,

party, but the persecuting spirit displayed against them is still
indefensible.
Summary of his excellencies and defects.
The divine whose character and writings we are
to consider to-day, if he can scarcely be called one of
the greatest men of the Church of England, was yet
54 CLASSIC  PKEACHEES :
endowed with one remarkable gift which has never
been common amongst her writers. He was, perhaps,
the most powerful rhetorician, not excepting Jeremy
Taylor, whom she has produced; and if we cannot
call him her greatest preacher; if time, which has
only added to the glory of Bossuet and Massillon,
and which allows us still to study even Beveridge
and Barrow, has seen South pass into comparative
neglect, this is due to no want of natural power in
himself, but to the fact that the value of his writings
is impaired by so large an alloy of party spirit, and
that he gave such full scope to his powers of sarcasm
and invective, that  it is  very difficult to give an
adequate   idea   of   his  Sermons   without   quoting
passages  which   modern  taste  would  reject.     He
lived, indeed,   at a time which proverbially tries the
tempers of men—at the close of a great revolution,
when  much judgment   and   moderation  were   re-
quired to meet the wants of the Church of Eng-
land, then at the end  of the struggles which had
marked the first century of her history, and violently
agitated  both by the  remembrance of her  suffer-
ings under Cromwell, and by her sudden victory at
the Kestoration of 1660.    Her long conflict might
at   first   sight  appear  to  have   been  of   eminent
service to the Churcli, for it had given birth, both
within and without her pale, to a line of eminent
men, and a vigour and a variety of thought greater
than she had hitherto  known.    Thus the generous
SOUTH. 55
love of learning—which was perhaps the brightest
feature in the character of Archbishop Laud, and
which led him to encourage men of ability in schools
very different from his own—bad already produced
ChilliDgwortb, Hales, and Jeremy Taylor; Sander-
son was still alive, and Hammond only recently
dead; Pearson was at the height of his reputation ;
South and Bull, and Beveridge and Barrow were
already conspicuous ; w bile, not to speak of Baxter and
Howe, who had not yet left her pale, a new school of
eminent men had arisen, of whom Tillotson, Stilling-
fleet, and Burnet were the chief active representa-
tives ; and who, closely allied with an original class
of thinkers at Cambridge, were forming (what had
hitherto been scarcely known) a Moderate party
in the Church. But this list is itself enough to
show us not merely the greatness of the Church of
England in those days, but also its difficulties;
for it is evident that all the modern elements of
thought and contest which exist in our present
Church were alive, if they were not yet active,
soon after the Eestoration, and it would have re-
quired no small power in the leading prelates to
restrain this extraordinary outburst of theological
thought within the limits of a single Church.
Without imagining that elements so diverse could
have been brought into perfect harmon}, we are
apt at such periods to long for the presence of a
master-mind, and it cannot be  said that Sheldon,
56 CLASSIC  PEE AC HERS :
Ward, and Sancroft, or even Cosin, were adequate
to the emergency. The general tone and temper
adopted by South, who was incomparably their
greatest preacher, will throw some light on the diffi-
culties and the failures of the Church.
The difficulties, indeed, to which I have alluded,
and which must never be forgotten in judging the
conduct of the Church of England at this critical
period of her existence, were simply due to that
cause which has always been both its strength and
weakness—the attempt to be, in a true sense, large
and national. The very circumstances of its origin
have forced it to include within its pale schools
of religious thought which no other Church has
attempted to unite. Half Catholic and half Protes-
tant under Henry VIII. and Cranmer—Lutheranised
under Edward VL, and involved in a bloody struggle
by Mary—it was not able to adopt the narrow and
one-sided system of Luther or Calvin; and it soon
discovered, when it began to take a more definite
form under Elizabeth, that the spirit of the old
religion was still powerful, and that much of the
best religious thought of England retained a strong
Catholic impress. The reign of Mary, indeed, had
embittered the popular feeling against the Koman
Catholics, and they were almost crushed as a party by
the ruthless cruelty of Elizabeth; but the Calvinistic
party never took their place, and the great ' Ecclesi-
astical Polity'  of Hooker,  the earliest  and  most
SOUTH. 57
lasting work of English theology, confirmed the
principal teachers of the English Church in that
warm attachment to the Church of the earliest ages
of Christianity which was but little known to the
other Churches of the Keformation. But tlie inde-
pendent spirit of Calvinism, though thus rejected by
the greatest of the English clergy, early obtained
an influence which was, perhaps, rather political than
religious, over many of the ablest men of the English
gentry and middle classes; and it was owing to
the alliance of the Church party, and especially of
Archbishop Laud, with the despotism of James and
Charles, that Eliot, Hampden, Pym, Cromwell, in
a word, of some of the greatest politicians whom
England has ever produced, were mostly Noncon-
formists. Thus the great Civil War was a struggle
between religious as well as political principles; but
though for a while Calvinism was triumphant, its
very victory was its destruction. The ten years of
the reign of the Puritans are perhaps the most
convincing evidence that Calvinism, from its narrow-
ness, bitterness, and want of reason, can never either
attract the mass, or satisfy the most thoughtful, of
our countrymen. When it fell, the old Church of
England at once resumed its place; but it was no
longer the same as it had been in the days of Andrewes
and Laud, for it had all the fresh elements of
religious thought and activity, of which I have just
spoken, to mould or to struggle with.
58 CLASSIC preachers:
It is facts such as these wliich make the fifty years
from the Restoration in 166*0 to the beginniDg of the
eigliteenth century so marked a period in the history
of the Church of England, because it saw that Church
assume its final form and enter upon what may be
called its modern course. The High Church party,
(though the name was not yet known)* the Moderate
party, the Latitudinarian party, the Nonconformist
party, were now branching in different directions
from the two old parties of the Church of the
Puritans ; and it is certainly no small proof of the
large and Catholic character of the Church, that
Bull and South, and Pearson and Jeremy Taylor,
and Cudworth and Locke, and Boyle and Isaac
Newton, were not only able to live as its attached
members, but may be numbered amongst its greatest
writers. This is a fact which must not be forgotten
when we lament the failure of the larger attempts
at comprehension which were made in the reigns of
Charles II. and William. Meanwhile, it is needless
to add that this period was also one of vehement
struggle, in which Churchmen, Nonconformists, and
Koman Catholics had their alternate triumj)hs, and
which was likely, therefore, to breed a race of
vigorous  combatants.    No writer, in his  Sermons

especially, throws more light on the fierce contests of
the time than the brilliant preacher whom we now
proceed to describe.
Robert South, the son of an eminent London
merchant, was born in the year 1633; *' a period,"
says one of his biographers, " when the artifices of
designing sectaries against the established govern-
ment in Church and State made it necessary that
so bright an assertor of both should arise ;" and he
was early sent as a boy to Westminster School.
Westminster was then the scene of excitements
and riots, which remind us more of the earlier
outbursts of the French Revolutiou than of the
comparatively moderate course of our own civil war,
and South's boyish ears must have often heard
the shouts of the mob as they clamoured "Down
with the Bishops;" or denounced the Lords who
were supposed to be favourable to Strafford as
" Straffordians, enemies to their country."* The
instincts of the scholars of the "Eoyal School of
Westminster " were not very likely to be on the side
of the Puritans; and we shall easily believe one of
South's Sermons, preached long afterwards to the
School, in which he tells them that in the " very
worst of times, when it was his lot to be a member of
a school untaintedly loyal, we were really King's
scholars, as well as called so ;" and he adds that on
that very day, " that eternally black and infamous

publicly prayed for " (tliis was said to have been done

his sacred head was struck off."* His great master,
Busby, had early detected the remarkable talents
of *' that sulky boy," South; and he passed in the
same election with Locke to Christ Church, where he
was known, perhaps too early, as the great scholar
and wit of his day ; and he soon took an opportunity
in some public exercise in Christ Church Hall for
indulging, as a Puritan writer expresses it, "in a
violent invective against all the most serious pro-
fessors of godliness." For this, and some similar
performances, he was rebuked by Owen, whom
Cromwell had placed at the head of Christ Church, as
one who " sat in the seat of the scornful;" a rebuke
which he soon repaid in his earliest Sermon, on ' The
Professors of Godliness, but Workers of Iniquity,
with their sad countenances and hypocritical groan-
ings,' which was preached in 1659, during the
confusion of the Convention.!    The Kestoration of

well to the Deanery of Christ

that it would never be well with

Charles II., whicli almost immediately followed,
gave fuller scope to Souths abilities, and though
still a very young man (he was scarcely twenty-
seven) he was already the great preacher of the
University.
He at once seized the occasion of a Commission,
sent down immediately on Charles's return to re-
store Oxford to its pre-Cromwellian state, to preach
a powerful Sermon in favour of a learned clergy*—
"The Scribe instructed to the Kingdom of Heaven"
—in which he mixes several fine descriptions of the
character of Scripture oratory with his usual invec-
tives against his opponents. I will venture to quote,
thus early, a sino^le passage wliich will give us an
idea of both. " Where," he says, speaking of the
eloquence of Scripture, " where do we ever find sor-
row flowing in such a naturally prevailing pathos
as in the lamentations of Jeremiah ? One would
think that every letter was wrote with a tear, every
word was the noise of a breaking heart; that the
author was a man compacted of sorrows; disciplined to
prayer tliat Cromwell should not
die, which was but a lew minutes
before he expired, had now the
impudence to say to God, ' Thou
hast deceived us, and we were
deceived.' " Sterry, praying for
Kichard, used these indecent
words, next to blasphemy :
"Make him the brightness of
the Father's glory, and the ex-
press image of His person." If
such was the general Puritan
tone, it goes far to excuse South's
sarcasms. (Burnet's ' Own

tionless when Christ says that a Scribe must be
stocked with things new and old, we must not think
that he meant that he should have a hoard of old
sermons (whosoever made them), with a bundle of
new opinions; for this certainly would liave furnished
out such entertainment to his spiritual guests, as no
rightly-disposed palate could ever relish."*
It is probable that the applause from the Cavaliers,
which greeted these earliest outbursts of their long
pent-up indignation, was of real injury to South's
abilities and character, by making liim their favourite
paity preacher. He was quickly rewarded by being
chosen Public Orator in 1660, when he was only in
his twenty-eighth year; congratulated Clarendon on
liis inauguration as Chancellor in a brilliant speech;
was made one of his Chaplains, and appointed to
preach before the King at Whitehall. It was during
this Sermon that the Puritans declared that whilst
denouncing the great Eebellion he was seized with
such qualms of conscience that he was obliged to

leave the pulpit; but the feeling must have been
a very transitory one, for we may safely say that
almost every public discourse is deformed by de-
scriptions either of Oliver Cromwell as " the Great
]\Iaster of Misrule," or of " the blind adder " Milton,
or by vehement onslaughts on the Puritans and
Nonconformists. He was soon afterwards appointed
a Prebendary of Westminster, as well as Canon of
Christ Church, and the rest of his long life was
passed between Westminster and Oxford. He never
obtained, nor does it appear that he sought for, any
higher or more active preferment in the Church.
In Oxford a succession of great Deans—Fell, Aldrich,
and Atterbury, to say nothing of Canons like
Pococke, and students like Locke—had made Christ
Church the centre of the talent of the University,
which, according to the impartial testimony of Bur-
net, was now distinguishing itself as a place of real
learning, particularly in the Eastern languages and
in the Fathers, though the number of students was
small, and too much in accordance witli the character
of the Couit, which often resorted there. South was
the great University preacher, and his subsequent
career might be easily tracked by his Sermons.*  He,

sons of Princes," and we may be sure that all the
bitterest Acts of Parliament against the Dissenters—
the two Acts of Uniformity, the Cimventicle Act, the
Five Mile Act, which drove 2000 clergy out of the
Church of England and imprisoned Baxter and
Bunyan—received his hearty approbation. He even
carried his hatred of novelties so far, that, in the true
old style of Oxford, he denounced the newly-formed
Koyal Society, of which the eminent Bishop Ward of
Salisbury was the second President, in a speech, as
Public Orator. It would be very curious if we could
ascertain what were his relations with his old school-
fellow Locke, at Christ Church, in whose expulsion
he must have borne a part. He declared himself
ready to put on a buff coat against Monmouth ;
and would take no part whatever against James II.,
though he did not become a Nonjuror. But he, of
course, opposed every act of toleration or comprehen-
sion during the reign of William, and was a warm
supporter of Sacheverell in 1670; and one of his last
acts was an hearty adhesion to Lord Arran (whose
brother, the Duke of Ormond, had been just before
impeached for high treason), who was elected by the
Chapter to the High  Stewardship of Westminster
SOUTH. 65
—an office still in their gift—with the words, " Heart
and hand for ray Lord Arran." He died at the age
of eighty-three, in 1716.
South has made the following assertion in one
of his Sermons. " I look," he says, " upon the
old Church of England Koyalist (which I take to
be only another name for a man who prefers
his conscience before his interest) to be the best
Christian, and the most meritorious subject in the
world;" and certainly our first impression of his
character and powers from the above outline would
be that he was, above all, the preacher of the trium-
phant Cavaliers, the cardinal article of whose faith
was the Divine right of Kiugs, and who, in the full
sense of the term, had *'given up to party" talents
which were "meant for mankind." But this, though
in some respects true, would give a very inadequate
idea of the power of sermons which may be profitably
studied even now, for South was of the true blood
of the great orators—of Demosthenes and Burke,
as much as of Bossuet and Massillon. No doubt he
allowed both his passion and his wit to overrun,
and thus often to spoil, his style and his thoughts;
but if we can put this great defect out of sight,
he has almost every gift which marks the orator—
powers equally great of thought and expression; a
nervous and manly style, full, but never overcharged
with learning, and an admirable arrangement.
Burnet, whose remarks on the preaching of the day
[ST. JAMES'S.] F
66 CLASSIC  PEEACHEES:
in his ' Pastoral Care' are most valuable, speaks
slightingly of the English preachers before the
Restoration, but adds that since that time they had
greatly improved by studying the French; and it
was probably his dislike to South, whom he calls a
" learned, but ill-natured divine," which prevents him
from mentioning him when he is describing Tillotson
(strangely enough to our modern taste) as the best
preacher of his time. John Wesley, no bad judge
of the requisites for a preacher, p)laces *' the manly
sense of Dr. South" far ai)ove the talents, which
he much under-estimates, of the French preachers.
The preacher, indeed, with whom South might be
most naturally compared is Bossuet; and though he
is very inferior to that greatest master of sacred
oratory in dignity of style, and in tliat high tone of
religious earnestness which is Bossuet's crowning ex-
cellence, he perhaps surpasses him in the terse vigour
of his language, and his lively, if not always decorous,
illustrations. Let me try to establish some of these
statements by a closer examination of South's power
as a preacher.
First, South w^as a master both of arrangement and
analysis, without which neither written nor spoken
oratory are often efiScient; and we may often trace in
his clear divisions the effects of a close study of the
Ehetoric and Ethics of Aristotle. One of his greatest
Sermons, on " The Creation of Man in the Image of
God," is a good example of this.  Perhaps, indeed, we
SOUTH. 67
might hesitate in this critical age to invest the first
man vvitli all the powers of philosophy, and to say
that " An xlristotle was but the rubbish of an Adam,
and Athens but the rudiments of Paradise." But this
doubtful view does not affect either the clear analysis
or the animated description which South gives of
the powers of the human mind in its ideal state
of perfection. The main thought is very simple.
The image of God consists in the perfection of
the whole man divided under the three heads of the
Understanding, the Will, and the Passions, and he
vividly describes them all. It is difficult to give
any idea of his power without a few extracts.
" First," he says, " take man's noblest faculty,
the Understanding. It was then sublime, clear,
aspiring, and, as it were, the soul's upper region, lofty
and serene, free from the vapours and disturbances
of the lower affections. It was the leading, control-
ling faculty. All the passions wore the colours of
reason. It did not so much persuade as command.
It was not Consul but Dictator. Discourse was then
almost as quick as intuition. It was nimble in
proposing, firm in concluding. It could sooner
determine than now it can dispute. Like the
sun, it had both light and agility; it knew no rest
but in motion, no quiet but in activity. . . .It
arbitrated upon all the reports of Sense, and all the
varieties of Imagination, not, like a drowsy judge,
only  hearing,  but   also  directing   their  verdict."
F 2
Q8 CLASSIC   PllEACHERS:
Or let us take again the following example of
his power of analysing the passions. "The grand
leading affection of all," he tells us, " is Love.
This is the great instrument and engine of nature,
the bond and cement of society, the spring and
spirit of the universe. Love is such an affection as
cannot so properly be said to be in the soul, as the
soul to be in that. It is the whole man wrapt up into
one desire ; all the powers, vigour, and faculty of
the soul abridged into one inclination; and it is of
that active, restless nature, that it must of necessity
exert itself, so that it will fasten upon any inferior,
unsuitable object, rather than upon none at all.
The soul may sooner leave off to subsist than to
love; and, like the vine, it withers and dies if it
has nothing to embrace. Now this affection, in
its state of innocence, was happily pitched upon
its right object; it flamed up in direct fervour of
emotion to God and of charity to its neighbour. . . .
It was a vestal, and a virgin Are; and differed as
much from that which usually passes by its name
nowadays, as tlie vital heat from the burning of a
fever." ^
I have ventured to quote these passages at full
length, because in the case of a great preacher it
is absolutely necessary to allow him occasionally to
speak for himself; and even these extracts may
be enough to show that scarcely any gift of the
orator was wanting to South, except, indeed, that
SOUTH. 69
whicli gives the finish to all oratory, the genuine
enthusiasm which inspires the strongest appeals of
passionate feeling. This, the great power of the
highest preachers, is almost a necessity for the
religious orator, and it was the want of this in
South whicli left him the great rhetorician, and
made him fall short of the true orator. In this
respect he is certainly far inferior to Jeremy Taylor,
though I venture to think that Mr. Coleridge was
forofettinoj for a moment the essential distinction
between writing and speaking, when he calls Taylor
*'the most eloquent of divines;" and adds, "had I
said of men, Cicero would forgive me, and Demo-
sthenes nod assent."* We do not believe that
writings so diffuse and luxuriant as those of Taylor
ever achieved the great object of the orator, persua-
sion ; and this feeling is well expressed in a powerful
passage of South, who, if we may judge from some of
the expressions, seems to have been distinctly alluding
to his great contemporary. "' I speak the words
of soberness,' says St. Paul, ' and I preach the Gospel,
not with enticing words of man's wisdom.' This was
the way of the Apostles, discoursing of things sacred.
Nothing here of the fringes of the North Star;
nothing of 'nature's becoming unnatural;' nothing
of 'the down of angel's wings, or the beautiful locks
of cherubims;' no starched similitudes, introduced

witli a 'tluis have I seen a cloud rolling in its airy

to use a dialect which only pierced the conscience,
and made the hearers cry out, ' Men and brethren,
what sliall we do ?' It tickled not the ear, but
sunk into the heart; and when men came from such
sermons, they never commended the preacher for his
taking voice or gesture ; for the fineness of such a
simile, or the quaintness of such a sentence ; but
they spoke like men conquered by the overpowering
force and evidence of the most concerning truths,
much in the words of the two disciples going to
Emmaus, ' Did not our hearts burn within us while
He opened to us the Scriptures ?' "* Passages like
this show us at once the strength and the weakness
of South, and deepen our regret that so great a
master of " manly sense" should not also have been
the greatest religious teacher amongst our preachers.
We have already intimated the causes which made
South fall short of this great position, and which
would lead us rather to turn for the expression of
true devotional feeling to Jeremy Taylor or Barrow%
or Beveridge or Baxter. It is, however, only just to
South to say that in Sermons which naturally called
for high feeling, he could speak like a man " con-

quered," to use his own words, " by the force of over-
powering truth," as in the following description
of our Saviour's sufferings. " This," he says, " w^as
our Saviour's condition. There was a sword which
readied his very spirit, and pierced his soul, till it
bled through his body ; for they were the struggles
and agonies of tlie inward man, the labours and
stirrings of his restless thoughts, which cast his body
into that prodigious sweat. It was the spirit that
took the pains. It w^as that which was then treading
the winepress of God's wrath alone, till it made him
red in his apparel, and dyed all his garments with
blood. What thought can reach, or tongue express,
what our Saviour then felt within His own breast!
The image of all the sins of the world, for which He
was to suffer, then appeared clear and lively, and
express to His mind. He saw how much the honour
of the great God was abused by them, and how many
millions of poor souls they must have inevitably cast
under the pressure of a wrath infinite and intolerable,
should he not have turned the blow upon himself.
The horror of which then filled and amazed his
vast apprehensive soul, and those apprehensions
could not but affect his tender heart, then brimful
of the highest zeal for God's glory, and the most
relenting compassion for the souls of men, till it
fermented and boiled over with transport and agony,
and even forced its way through all his body,
in  those  strange  ebullitions  of blood,  not   to be
72 CLASSIC  PKEACHEES:
paralleled by the sufferings of any person recorded
in any history whatsoever." *
It will be obvious both from the above extracts,
and from the general description which has already
been given of South, that he comes before us in a
double character, and that his preaching was too
largely the reflection of his politics. His political
violence was in fact equally injurious to his charac-
ter, his judgment, and his eloquence. Thus we might
at first have expected that a man endowed with a
power of sarcasm equal to Juvenal would, at least,
have made his lash thoroughly felt by the vices of
the most immoral periol of English history, and
that he would not have spared the Court, which
was the centre of them all He was, indeed, to
all appearance a higli-principled, and certainly he
was an outspoken man, and there are no doubt
several occasions where he vigorously denounces the
vices of the day, as when he says that " all possible
courtship is now thought too little to be used
towards persons infamous and odious, and fit to be
visited by none but God Himself, who visits after a
very different manner from the courtiers of the ^^ orld."
But, speaking generally, it must be allowed that
South's hatred of vice is a far less prominent feature
in his preaching than his hatred of Nonconformity;
* iii. 85.
SOUTH. 73
for his predominant passions were an absolute
devotion to the Court, or at least to the King, and
an intense horror of what he called the " Holder-
forths " among the Puritans; and it is curious, and
at the same time painful, to observe the extent to
which those feelings absorbed and warped the moral
sense of an otherwise upright and manly judgment.
I am not, indeed, sure that, under any circumstances.
South would have been prepared to play the part of
John the Baptist, or to imitate the example of Ken,
in rebuking the vices of Charles II. But although
his intense veneration not only for the office but for
the person of the King undoubtedly made him a
less severe censor of the morals of the time than he
would otherwise have been, it would be unjust to
attribute his conduct to adulation. The devotion of
the English clergy and gentry even to the worst
of the Stuart Princes is due to a far better cause.
The death of King Charles I., as the contemporary
evidence of Bishop Burnet assures us, *'and his
serious and unsuspicious deportment in it, had made
all his former errors entirely forgot, and drew a
lasting hatred on the actors;" * and this may, in a
measure, account for the extravagant form in which
the " Divine Eight of Kings," a doctrine almost
unknown to English history till the days of the
Stuarts, was held by so many eminent divines, till it
* Burnet's ' Own Times,' i. 69.
74 CLASSIC  PREACHERS:
was rudely destroyed by the Revolution of 1688.
South was not very likely to be guarded in his
language in speaking of what he calls " the blackest
act which the sun ever saw since he hid his face at
the Crucifixion," and of which he says that '' to drop
the blackest ink and the bitterest gall upon such
an act is not satire, but propriety." Accordingly,
in one of his Sermons preached before the King,
which is perhaps the most extraordinary combina-
tion of eulogy and invective ever published, we find
him asserting not only that " Kings are endowed
by God with sagacity and quickness of understanding
above other men," and that God disposes their hearts
to such virtuous and pious courses, as He has pro-
mised a blessing to ;"* but he is so transported in his
eulogies of Charles I., as to sum them up by declar-
ing that " he was a father to his country, if but for
this only that he was the father to such a son."
It is needless to add, and it \\ ould be painful fully
to exhibit, the extent of South's animosity to the
Puritan party. We are not their apologists. In
many respects they may be regarded, their own
writers being the judges, as almost the most narrow,
bitter, and disagreeable sect which sprang from the
Reformation. Neither can we regard the ftiilure of
the Savoy Conference, the last attempt to retain the
bulk of the Puritans within the Church of England,

SOUTH. 70
as so unmixed an evil as  liberal  historians  have
described it; for it may well be doubted whether the
attempt to combine minds so different as those of
Baxter  and   Cosin,  the stiff Presbyterian and tlie
strict Anglo-Catholic, could have been permanently
successful.     The  Puritan  party was,   indeed,  still
very much the same that it was in its conflict with
Hooker.    There was the same  stickling for small
objects, the rejection of the Cross at Baptism and of
the Surplice, the same antipathy to introducing any
beauty or art into the worship of God, and the same
objection to those great principles of Church govern-
ment  which  Hooker  had  so   eloquently  asserted.
The tendency would have been, as the other leaders
of the  Church   party, like   Cosin  and  Sanderson,
probably saw, to form a schism within the Church
instead of without; or, as South expressed it, " By
yielding or giving place to them, a pernicious and
incurable  schism   would   have   been   brought  into
the   Church."*     Unquestionably there were to be
found among the Puritans men of eminent good-
ness  and  toleration   like   Baxter.     Nor need  we
hesitate to admire the courageous zeal even of the
fiery  zealots of Cromwell's  army,  or  the  evident
piety of most of their greatest writers.    Yet even
Baxter, judging by his own account and that of his
friends, was one of the most impracticable of men ;

CLASSIC  PREACHERS :
and as he described the Book of Common Prayer as
" a dose of opium, likely to cure diseases by extin-
guishing life," he may be believed when he himself
says, '' that the world will see that we differ in greater
things than ceremonies and forms of prayer."* We
cannot, therefore, but regard the attempt to widen
the Church of England in a Presbyterian direction,
which was made at the Savoy Conference in 1662,
as a matter of doubtful policy, which the Church
party may have well been wise in resisting. But
the persecution of the Puritans which followed was
a very different matter. The Act of Uniformity,
the Conventicle Act, and the Five Mile Act, are
quite as odious in principle as the Bevocation of the
Edict of Nantes ; they were forced upon a reluctant
King, who had pledged his word to the Presbyterians
that he would secure for them freedom of worship ;
and the last and most cruel was passed at the very
time when the Nonconformists had rendered eminent
service during the Plague in London by preaching
in the '^ empty pulpits," deserted, in too many
instances, by their own clergy.t The tone adopted
by South was a direct instigation to measures of this
kind, and was probably prompted by their authors.

be easy to quote many passages full of his caustic
wit on this subject; but I shall only give one short
extract from a Sermon preached in 1871, when the
contest with the Nonconformists was still raging.
Their tenderness " of conscience," says South, " is
such an one as makes men scruple at the lawfulness
of a set form of worship, at the use of some solemn
rites and ceremonies in the worship of God, but
makes them not stick at all at sacrilege, nor at
rebellion, nor at the murder of their King, nor at
the robbery and undoing of their fellow-subjects;
villainies which not only Christianity proscribes, but
the common reason of mankind rises up against, and
by the very light of nature condemns. And did not
those among us who plead tenderness of conscience
do all these things ? Nay, did they not do them in
the very strength of this plea ? " *
It is painful to quote invectives which nothing
can justify, yet it may be said, as a final excuse for
South, that this feeling was, for a time at least, that
of the whole nation, of the laity quite as much as
the clergy. Clarendon and Southampton, Charles's
best ministers, shared it. The Puritan party was,
in fact, now suffering the penalty of ten years of
tyranny, when, in the words of a historian nowise
unfavourable to them, "they had forbidden, under
heavy penalties, the use of the Book of Common

exposed to the outrages of a fanatical rabble :"* when
so much that was beautiful in Churches and Cathe-
drals had been ruthlessly defaced, and almost every-
thing which reminded men that Christ's religion
had been dear to their forefathers for sixteen cen-

we are inclined to judge South, and even prelates
like Cosin, with severity, we must remember that
their language often only expresses the indignation
which even religious men will feel against a tyrannous
attempt to injure Christianity by limiting it to the
teaching of a narrow and intolerant sect.
In the above remarks on the writings of this
eminent man, I may possibly appear to have dwelt
too much on the defective side of his character. But
the palm of sacred oratory is not to be won even
by the highest intellectual gifts alone; and while I
have gladly recognised the natural genius of South
as an Orator, I have felt that it is equally important
to exhibit  the causes of his failure to attain the

hiohest rank as a Preacher. I Lave endeavoured, in
a word, to describe Soutli's sermons justly; botli
as they show the power of the man and the charac-
ter of his times—which iofluenced him, in some
respects, so unfortunately. He was, perhaps, born
with too keen and caustic a wit, and he indulged
it too unsparingly, ever to have been either a
great man or a great preacher; for wit like his
tends to make men contemptuous of their fellows,
and is seldom consistent with that generous en-
thusiasm which is essential to true eloquence. But
his natural powers, both of thought and expression,
though they were often unwisely exercised, were
as great as could be found in any preacher, either
ancient or modern. And if we acknowledge with
regret that in the gentler, sweeter, and tenderer
feelings, which are the crowning glory of the Christian
preacher. South was deficient, we may still believe
that writings marked by such powers of thought
and expression, so rich in learning, in wit, and in
illustration, and with so much of moral and religious
wisdom, can never fail to be an instructive and often

and he goes on to complain that '* we find but few
that are ever the more religious for all they hear; "
a complaint which is very familiar to us in every age
of the Church.
It is quite possible to exaggerate the importance
of sermons, and it may be conceded that the mere

82 CLASSIC  PREACHEES:
amount of preaching or of hearing will form a very
uncertain measure of the depth and extent of religious
life among a people. Yet no one can deny that a
revival of religion has always been accompanied by
an increased interest in the ordinance of preaching;
and it would be difficult to suggest a better means of
ascertaining the prevailing religious sentiments of
an age, than a complete and careful study of the
sermons, which, as a matter of fact, were listened to
by the Christian congregations of that age. The
preacher is made by his age, and he in his turn
helps to make it. In proportion to his influence,
he is both representative of the spirit and modes of
thought of the generation to which he belongs, and
a power by which that spirit and those thoughts
are moulded.
It is, however, a much easier task to ascertain the
doctrinal position, or even the historical influence of
the preachers of past times, than to estimate their
oratorical powers, or the secret of their influence in
the pulpit. Oratory is not a mere matter of words,
of phrases, of arguments, of method; it is, in its
highest forms, the outgoing of the life—intellectual,
moral, spiritual—of the preacher, upon the life and
soul of his hearers. It is conveyed as much by tone,
manner, gesture, as by language; and even when we
read the words which have moved multitudes to the
very depth of their being, a few hours after they
have been delivered, we are often unable to under-
BEVERIDGE. 83
stand the secret of their power; liow much more
when the circumstances in which they were spoken
are forgotten, or removed into a distant past, and we
are no longer under the influence of the ideas and
habits to which they appealed !
There is, perhaps, a peculiar difficulty in studying
a preacher like Beveridge, who was but little con-
nected with the more stirring events of his times;
and who presents few of those striking peculiarities
by which some preachers, in no other respect superior
to himself, have been distinguished. Yet this ob-
vious difficulty is undoubtedly counterbalanced by
the advantage that he deals, for the most part,
with subjects which are of abiding and eternal
interest. In this respect, as in so many others, his
sermons are like the Book which he delighted to
study, speaking to us of human sinfulness and weak-
ness, of Divine mercy and grace, of the life of God
in the soul of man, of the means of grace and the
hope of glory. Like the Psalms of David, they are
full of words which, if they are hoary with age, are
also fresh with the bloom of everlasting youth, which
awaken an echo as true in the hearts of the servants
of God in our own times, as in the days long gone by
in which they were first uttered.
We shall, perhaps, best understand the work of
Bishop Beveridge, if we first consider his general
characteristics as a preacher and a divine, and then
note  briefly  how the man  and  the preacher was
G 2

made, and finally endeavour to set forth some of the
most prominent features of his method and manner
as a teacher.
We have called Beveridge the " Scriptural
Preacher." The very designation is an evidence of
the difficulty of affixing any special characteristic to
his genius. Yet it would not be easy to find another
word which would be so truly and exactly descriptive,
and it would be equally difficult, I fancy, to find
another preacher to whom the title could be so
justly applied.
It is not merely that there are few preachers of
any age who make such copious use of Holy Scrip-
ture in their sermons, although this is true. It
would not be just to say that lie strings together
texts from Scripture to supply the place of thought
and matter of his own. It would be still less true
to say that he drags in the words of the sacred
writers without relevancy to the subject which he
has in hand, or the point which he is seeking to
establish. There are pulpit orators who are scrip-
tural preachers in this bad sense of the words. It
is not so with Beveridge. You hardly ever find a text
misapplied, or which is not to the point. You hardly
ever find a meaning forced out of the sacred Word to
suit the purpose for which he employs it. Beveridge
was a scriptural preacher because his own spirit was
bathed in the spirit of the Word of God. He loved
the Bible: God's testimonies were indeed his delight
BEVEEIDGE. 85
and his counsellors. He spoke in scriptural language,
because he thought in it, felt in it, lived in it, worked
in it, prayed in it.
Nor was he one of those—and they abound in all
ages—who make the claim to be a true interpreter of
Holy Scripture a means of promulgating their own
private opinions, and often their own departures
from Catholic truth. He would put no man or
church between him and the Bible; he would hold
direct converse with the Spirit of God through His
appointed oracles; but he also watched jealously
over his own conclusions, and verified them by pri^
mitive testimony and Catholic consent.
" The Scriptures," he says, " as being indited by
the Spirit of God, do contain the best and soundest
words that possibly could be invented, whereby to
express such truths as are necessary for mankind to
believe or know." Yet, he points out that *'there
never was any error, heresy, or schism in the Church,
but was pretended 'by the authors and abettors of it
to be grounded upon Scripture." And this result,
he says, has followed partly from their being igno-
rant of the original languages in which the Scriptures
were written, partly from their being unacquainted
with " the rites and customs of the Jewish Church,"
partly from the mysterious nature of the doctrines
contained in the Scriptures, and partly from the
moral and spiritual dispositions of those who have
studied the Bible.    " Such," he says, " is the weak-

ness of men's understandings, such tlie corruption of
their judgments, such the perverseness of their wills,
the disorder of their affections, and the pravity of
their whole souls, that they extract poison from that
which was intended for their food, draw error out of
truth, heresy out of the Scriptures themselves, so as
to learn to blaspheme God in His own words. But
what, then, sliall we do in this case ? How can we
be ever certain that the words we use in matters of
religion be sound, and, by consequence, our opinions
orthodox, and our sentiments of God and those
eternal truths which He hath revealed to us, such as
He Himself would have them ? Why, surely for
this end it is necessary that we indulge not our own
fancies, nor idolise our own private opinions, but
' hold fast the form of sound words' delivered to us
in the Holy Scriptures, in that sense which the
Catholic Church in all ages hath put upon them." *
In these words we have the key to Beveridge's
whole position, as a student of Holy Scripture, as a
theologian, as a Churchman. How he was fashioned
by circumstances, by the grace of God, by his own
earnest labours, to be the man he was, we shall pre-

labours as a parish priest, liis resolute antagonism to
Eomanism on the one hand and to Puritanism on the
other, are all explained by his views of the method
of ascertaining the nature of Divine truth. Thus,
speaking of the Church of England, he says :—" For
our Church, as to its doctrine as well as discipline,
is settled upon so firm a basis, so truly Catholic,
that none can oppose what she teacheth, wdthout
denying, not only the Scriptures, but the Scrip-
tures as interpreted by the Universal Church.
So that we may justly challenge all the world to
show us any one point or article of faith wherein our
Church differs from the Catholic in all ages, since
the Apostles' days, which, I think, is more than can
be said of any other national Church in the whole
world, there being no other, that I know of, which
keeps to the form of sound words delivered in
Scripture, as interpreted by the Universal Church,
so firmly and constantly as ours doth."*
Hence his opinion of the Koman Communion:—
" The Church of Rome hath of late degenerated so
far from the doctrine and practice of the Primitive
and Universal Church, that they who live in her
communion, do commonly perform the same acts
of religious worship to creatures which they do to
the great Creator of the world, * God blessed for
ever.'    This we justly condemn them for, as judging

it one of the greatest sins tliat a Church or person
can be guilty of. But in the midst of this our just
zeal against the Papists for giving as much worship
to creatures as they do to the Creator, we must have
a care of falling into the other extreme, even of
giving no more w^orship to our Creator than what may
be given to a creature; which is the great fault of
too many among us.*
Equally clear were his utterances against Puritan-
ism. "And as for schism, they certainly hazard
their salvation at a strange rate, who separate them-
selves from such a Church as ours is, wherein the
Apostolical succession, the root of all Christian com-
munion, hath been so entirely preserved, and the
Word and Sacraments are so effectively administered.
. . . And therefore, to speak modestly, they must
needs run a very great hazard who cut themselves
off from ours, and by consequence from the Catholic
Church, and so render themselves incapable of re-
ceiving any benefit from this promise, or from the
means of grace which they do or may enjoy." And
yet he was no formalist, for he goes on : " But when
I speak of your continuing firm and faithful to our
Church, I do not mean that you should only talk
high for her, much less inveigh against her adver-
saries, or damn all those who are not of her
communion ; for this is contrary to the Divine and

Apostolic spirit that is in her, which is a spirit of
meekness, and soberness, and charity. But my
meaning is that you firmly believe whatsoever she,
from the Word of God, propounds as an article of
faith, and faithfully perform whatever she, from the
same Word, requires as a necessary duty to God or
man. . . . And oh ! that all we who are here present,
and all that profess to be of our Church, wheresoever
they are, would for the future do so! What an holy,
what a happy people we should then be ! How pious
towards God, how loyal to our Sovereign, how just
and charitable towards all men ! . . . Then our Lord
Himself would delight to dwell amongst us, and be
always present with us, not only by His spirit, but
likewise by His power too. And if He be with us,
we need not fear what flesli can do against us." *
We have thus learned to understand the theological
position of Beveridge. Before we attempt more fully
to comprehend the preacher, we must try to make
acquaintance with the man ; for we must remember,
—and it is a solemn truth for priests and people,—
it is the man who preaches, it is the inner life of the
speaker that comes forth in his words, and determines
their value and their power, or their unreality and
their weakness.
The recorded incidents of Beveridge's life are few,
and they are not striking.    He was born early in the

year 1636 (N.S. 1637),* in the parish of Barrow-
upon-Soar, in Leicestershire, of which parish his father
was vicar.    The troubles which led to the Civil War
and to the Commonwealth were in full progress.    In
the year of his birth, Laud's Liturgy was introduced
into Scotland.    In the following year Hampden was
condemned for his refusal to pay the ship-money.
He was a boy of twelve when the King's head fell on
the block at Whitehall.    His father had died, and
another of the same name, perhaps an uncle, had
been deprived by the sequestrators.    In the year
1653 he entered S. John's College, Cambridge, the
same year, and within a month of the time when
Cromwell dissolved the Long Parliament.    We can

of the young Churchman when he became a member
of the University.    Here the influences under which
he w^as placed were all opposed to the teachings of
his  childhood.     Dr.  Tuckney. the  master  of his
College, was a distinguished Puritan and Calvinist;
he was one of the Presbyterian divines at the Savoy

was he satisfied to hold it with mere unreasoning
constancy.    He addicted himself with devotion and

success to the study of oriental languages, of Holy
Scripture, of the early records of the History of the
Church. Before he was twenty he had written a
grammar of the Syriac language. The fruits of his
patristic and ecclesiastical studies were afterwards
given to the world in his works on the Apostolical
Canons and the decrees of the early Councils.* These
works have indeed been in great measure superseded;
but they contributed in no slight degree to advance
those deeply interesting and important studies, and
they are still quoted with respect by the most recent
labourers in the same field. Beveridge felt in his
day, as we feel now, that if the position of the Church
of England is unassailable, it is because she stands
firm upon Holy Scripture, primitive testimony,
Catholic consent. It is this conviction which makes
his utterances so clear^ decided, unwavering. He
was not only convinced, but he knew well the grounds
on which his convictions were based.
But he was not a mere scholar and theologian ; he
was a devout Christian, and all his studies were con-
ducted to the end that he might more perfectly know
the will of God, in order that he might acquaint
himself with Him, love Him, and serve Him. His

* The'Pandectse'appeared ia

life, although not published until after his death, are
an abiding testimony to the reality, the depth, the
warmth of his devotion. Thus prepared in heart and
mind, he had attained to the age of twenty-three at
the time of the Restoration, and was in the following
year (1661) ordained deacon and priest, and insti-
tuted to the Vicarage of Ealing.
Eleven years afterwards, in 1672, he was ap-
pointed rector of S. Peter's, Cornhill, in which office
he spent the best part of his life, a period of no
less than thirty years. It was here, therefore, that
the great work of his life was done; and it is in this
work that we naturally look for an illustration of
those principles of which he was the consistent
advocate.    Nor do we look in vain.
At the very beginning of his ministry he set
before his new parishioners that which was the con-
stant theme of his teaching, " holiness the great end
of the Christian dispensation;" and he showed them
that, however ardent his Churchmanship, however
staunch his orthodoxy, no result but this could satisfy
him, that they should be a pattern to others for piety
and true holiness. " How happy should I think
myself," he exclaims, " if it would please God to
make me, the unworthiest of His servants, an instru-
ment in His almighty hand towards the effecting
of it in this place!"
Beveridge had formed to himself a distinct and
lofty ideal of the Christian life which he would cul-

tivate in himself, and which he strove to produce in
others. It was, to use his own expression, "the
exemplary holiness of the primitive Christians," that
he proposed to his people as their model; and he
tauo:ht them that such a character could be attained
only by the use of those means which the primitive
Christians employed. For this reason he always laid
great stress upon regular, devout, and frequent atten-
dance at the table of the Lord. On this subject his
admonitions are earnest and repeated. Thus, speaking
of the Holy Communion, he says: " This sacrament
supplies the defect of all the Levitical sacrifices, the
paschal lamb, the sin-offerings, the trespass-offerings,
the peace-offerings, the thank-offerings, the whole
burnt-offerings, they are all now laid aside, and this
one substituted in their place, of more power and
efficacy to the ends for which they were ordained
than all they put together; for they only foreshowed
Christ's death until it happened, this shows it forth
to the end of the world; for, as the A^postle saith,
* As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup,
ye do show the Lord's death till he come.'"...
" It is true," he goes on, " He hath prescribed no
set times for it, as he did for the sacrifices under the
law ; yet, however, seeing it eomes in their place, it
ought to bear some proportion with them in this
respect, at least so far, that as they, besides their daily,
had their weekly sacrifices more than ordinary upon
the Sabbath-day; so we should celebrate this Holy

" Especially considering the mighty benefits and
advantages that accrue to us by a due and worthy
receiving of this Holy Sacrament. Hereby we are
put in mind of the sinfulness of sin, and the dread-
ful punishments which are due unto it, seeing
nothing less than the blood of the Son of God could
expiate it. Hereby our minds are set against it, and
our whole souls are taught to abhor and loathe it.
Hereby we exercise our faith in Christ, for the
pardon of all our faults, and have them accordingly

and to serve God with a perfect heart and a willing
mind; hereby we dwell in Christ and Christ in us."*
In another Sermon,! speaking on the same subject,
he exclaims : " Blessed be God for it, you have the
same opportunity as they had of receiving the Holy
Sacrament every Lord's Lay, and therefore be ad-
vised to follow their example, in being constantly
at it, or at least as often as you possibly can; do not

of the greatest blessing 3'ou can have on this side
heaven."
From one of his most remarkable sermons, that
on " the exemplary holiness of the primitive
Christians,"* as well as from contemporary testi-
mony, we learn that these exhortations liad not been
in vain. " In the place," he says, " where I had the
honour to serve God at His altar, before He called
me hither, I administered it every Lord's Day for
above twenty years together, and was so far from
ever wanting communicants, that I had always as
many as I and two curates could well administer
it to them; for people found such extraordinary
benefit and ghostly comfort from it, tJiat they
never thought they could receive it often enough;
and the oftener they received it the more they still
desired it."
The effect of his teaching, his example, his labours,
among the people of his parish, soon became con-
spicuous. "He applied himself," it is said, "with
the utmost labour and zeal to the discharge of his
ministry in its several parts and offices; and so
instructive was he in his discourse, from the pulpit,
so warm and affectionate in his private exhortations,
so regular and uniform in the public worship of the
Church, and in every part of his pastoral functions,
and so remarkably were his labours crowned with
success, that as he himself was justly styled the ' great

reviver and restorer of primitive piety,' so his parish
was deservedly proposed as the best model and
pattern for the rest of its neighbours to copy
after." *
While Rector of S. Peter's, he was made succes-
sively Prebendary of S. Paul's (1674), Archdeacon
of Colchester (1681), and Prebendary of Canterbury
(1684). The same zeal which he showed in his
parish he carried into the work of his Archdeaconry.
Doubtful, and reasonably doubtful, of the accuracy
of Churchwardens' reports, he visited in person
every parish in his district, taking an exact account
of its condition and necessities.
When at Canterbury he gave a remarkable ex-
ample of his somewhat severe Churchmanship. King
James II. had ordered a brief to be read for the re-
lief of the persecuted French Protestants. Whether
because of his imperfect sympathy with the object
of the appeal, or because he really doubted of the
legality of such a notice, Beveridge objected that
it was not sanctioned by the rubrics. It was on
this occasion that Tillotson, who was then Dean of
Canterbury, addressed to him the well-known taunt,
'* Doctor, doctor. Charity is above rubrics ! "
It is not unlikely, however, that he was beginning
to see that King James's new-born zeal for toleration
was used only as a means of restoring  the  papal

power in England. We know, at least, tliat he was
about this time the member of a society which met
in private for consultation on this subject, and for
prayer that such an evil might be averted.
At the revolution, he did not hesitate to take the
oath of allegiance to William and Mary, and was
shortly afterwards (1690) made one of the King's
chaplains. He was also a prominent member of
Convocation, and took an active part in the debates
on the subject of the concessions which were pro-
posed to be made for the reconciliation of the
Puritans. Beveridi2:e was not uuvvillinir to meet the
party with which he had little personal or eccle-
siastical sympathy; but he strenuously opposed any
surrender of what he regarded as principle. Before
the Convocation of 1689 he " preached a Latin
Sermon,* in which he warmly eulogised the existing
system, and yet declared himself favourable to a
moderate reform. Ecclesiastical laws, he said, were
of two kinds. Some laws were fundamental and
eternal; they derived their authority from God;
nor could any religious community abrogate them
without ceasing to form a part of the universal
Church. Other laws were local and temporary.
They had been framed by human wisdom, and might
be altered by human wisdom. They ought not, in-
deed, to be altered without grave reasons. But surely,
at  that  moment, such  reasons were  not  wanting.

98 CLASSIC  PREACHERS :
To unite a scattered flock in one fold under one
shepherd, to remove stumbling-blocks from the path
of the weak, to reconcile hearts long estranged, to
restore spiritual discipline to its primitive vigour,
to place the best and purest of Christian Societies on
a base broad enough to stand against all the attacks
of earth and hell, these were objects which might
well justify some modification, not of Catholic insti-
tutions, but of national or provincial usages."
In 1691, on Ken's refusal to take the oath of alle-
giance, Beveridge was offered the bishopric of Bath
and Wells. His conduct on this occasion has been
greatly misunderstood; Macaulay speaks of him as
being " though an honest, not a strong-minded man; "
yet the explanation of his indecision and of his final
resolution to decline the office, is very simple. On
the one hand, Beveridge had no doubt of the lawful-
ness of accepting the appointment from King William,
as he had already taken the oaths: on the other
hand, he was unwilling to sit on the throne from
which the saintly Ken had been thrust out. After
considerable hesitation, by tlie advice of Archbishop
Sancroft, he refused the bishopric. His scrupulosity
did not protect him from the attacks of the pam-
phleteers of his day ; but there are few w^ho will now
refuse to do honour to the motives by which he was
influenced. It will not at least be denied that he
relinquished a post of honour and dignity, and he
seems, besides, to have forfeited the favour of the

King, for he was offered no further promotion until
the reign of Queen Anne.
By this Queen he was in 1704, Avhen he was
already sixty-seven years of age, promoted to the See
of S. Asaph, where he laboured for about four years
with the same apostolic zeal and fervour which he
had shown in a less elevated position. " He was no
sooner exalted to the Episcopal Chair," says the
editor of the ' Private Thoughts,' " but in a most
pathetic and obliging letter to the clergy of his
diocese, he recommended to them * the duty of cate-
chising and instructing the people committed to their
charge, in the principles of the Christian religion;
to the end they might know what they were to
believe and do in order to salvation;' and told them
' he thought it necessary to begin with that without
which, whatever else he or they should do, would
turn to little or no account, as to the main end of
the ministry.' And to enable them to do this the
more effectually, he sent them a plain and easy ' ex-
position upon the Church Catechism.' "
He died at his lodging in the Cloisters of West-
minster Abbey, on the 5th of March, 1707 (N.S.
1708); and was buried in S. Paul's Cathedral He
died as he had lived, wdth a heart full of love to God
and man, and with an unwavering devotion to the
Church in which he had ministered. After making
a certain provision for his relatives, he left the bulk
of his property to the recently-founded Gospel Pro-

pagation Society and Christian Knowledge Society ;
but his zeal for the Church had not made him forget-
ful of the needs of the people among whom he was
born. To eight of the poor housekeepers of Barrow
he left forty shillings a year, to be distributed equally
among them on Christmas Eve, regard being had in
the selection to those who had been most constant at
prayers, and at the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper
the foregoing year; and to the Curacy of Mount
Sorrel and Yicarage of Barrow he bequeathed twenty
pounds a year for ever, on condition that Morning
and Evening Prayer should be read daily in the
chapel and parish church ; and if it should so happen
that this provision should not be carried out, then
his bequest was to be applied for the instruction of
children in the principles of the Christian religion,
according to the doctrine of the Church of England.
Such was Bishop Beveridge as a man, a Chiistian
a teacher of the Christian faith. But the question
may still be asked as to the rank which may fairly
be conceded to him among the great preachers of
past times. On this point opinions will always differ;
but an impartial judgment will not refuse him a high
place among the faithful, the earnest, the eloquent
witnesses for Divine truth.
It is true that he was not free from some of the
faults of his age. He may have committed himself
to statements on the subject of human reason and
its relation to Divine revelation which we could not
BEVERIDGE. 101
accept. He has been accused of Higli Calvinism ;
but a candid examination of his writings will not
support the charge. On some occasions, indeed, he
was carried away by his feelings to forget the solemn
caution of Christ against supposing that the greatest
sufferers were the greatest sinners. He compares
King Charles, without any apparent misgiving, to
the Proto-Martyr, S. Stephen.* He does not hesi-
tate to declare that the Fire of London was sent as a
punishment for the great rebellion and the murder
of the King, in wliich the City had so great a part.j
These may have been faults of taste and judgment;
but they will not be greatly regarded in a general
estimate of his work.
A German writer, who speaks highly of his books
on the Canons, says his religious writings are of small
value ; and a French author tells us that his sermons
have nothing very extraordinary in point of profun-
dity of ideas. This may be in a measure true, and
we can hardly put him in the very highest rank of
preachers. He had not the gorgeous imagination
of Taylor, or the polished eloquence of Massillon,
or the eagle wing of Bossuet. Those, moreover, who
regard florid language, heaped-up metaphors, or
flights of fancy as a necessary adjunct to true
eloquence, will deny that he was eloquent. But
those who judge by truer canons of criticism, will

acknowledge that he was not destitute of this great
gift of God.
If well-ordered thoughts expressed in language,
pure, simple, and fervent, spoken by a tongue whose
every utterance was truth and goodness, kindled by
the glowing fire of love to God and to man ; if these
things constitute eloquence, then Beveridge must
have been eloquent. " He had a way," said the
pious Kobert Nelson, in his life of Bishop Bull, *' of
gaining people's hearts and touching their con-
sciences, which bore some resemblance to the
Apostolic age ; and, when it shall appear that those
bright preachers, who have been ready to throw
contempt upon his Lordship's performances, can set
forth as large a list of persons whom they have con-
verted by their preaching, as I could produce of
those who owed the change of their lives, under
God, to the instructions of this pious prelate, I shall
readily own that they are superior to his Lordship in
the pulpit; though, considering what learned works
he published in the cause of religion, and what an
eminent pattern he was of true primitive piety, I am
not inclined to think that his Lordship will, upon the
whole of his character, be easily equalled by any one."
Even if we caimot go so far as a contemporary
writer* who quotes a passage from one of his Sermons,
which  may,   he   says, "in acuteness of judgment.

ornament of speech, and true sublime, compare
with any of the choicest writings of the ancient
Fathers," we shall hardly quarrel with the testimony
of another,* who says : " There is something so great,
primitive, and apostolical, in his writings, that it
creates an awe and veneration in our mind; the im-
portance of his subjects is above the decoration of
words; and what is great and majestical in itself,
looketh the most like itself the less it is adorned."
It would be easy, did our time permit, to give
multitudes of examples of the homely directness,
the serious and affectionate earnestness, the powerful
incisiveness, with which he appeals to the consciences
of his liearers, now warning them of the danger of
impenitence, and again setting forth the fatherly
love and mercy and grace of Almighty God.
Take, for example, the beginning of his Sermon on
"the exemplary holiness of the primitive Christians,"
as a specimen of his plain and direct dealing with
the conscience of his hearers.
*' Having this opportunity of preaching the word
of God to you, I heartily wish that I could do it so
effectually, that by His blessing upon it, ye may all

as the Thessalooians did, * not as the word of men,
but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectu-
ally worketh also in you tliat believe.'"
Towards the end of the same Sermon, he goes on:
" This, therefore, is that which I would now persuade
you all to do, and should think myself happy if I
could do it. Play no longer with religion, as people
commonly do, but set upon the practice of it in good
earnest. As ye profess to believe the Gospel, live
according to the rules and precepts of it, that ye
may adorn your holy profession with a suitable con-
versation. . . . Strive all ye can to shine as lights
in the world, that ye may be the great examples of
true piety and virtue to one another, and to all that
are about you. This would be the most effectual
means to convince the enemies of our Church and
holy religion of their errors and mistakes, when they
see you who profess it, so far exceeding and outdoing
them in your constancy at your devotions, in your
frequency at the Holy Communion; in your temper-
ance and sobriety; in your meekness, patience, and
humility; in your truth and justice in all your
dealings together; in your liberality to your poor
brethren; in your zeal for God; in your loyalty to
your Sovereign; in your kindness, love, and charity
to one another; and in all such good works as God

callings to walk in ;  still trusting in your blessed

" This is the way, too, to have a place ready pre-

self, in all ease and plenty, in all the joy, happiness,
and glory that creatures are capable of, not only for
some time, but to all eternity, and all through His
merits and mediation for you."*
It would be easy to multiply examples of the
application of his subject, which must have been
not simply what we call effective, but most deeply
impressive. Let us take only one other example
from his Sermon on the *' wisdom of being holy."
The text of the Sermon is, " The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom:" '^ Men and brethren, I
have endeavoured to show and prove this day, that
every sinner is a fool, and every sin a folly. I know
there are many understanding persons among you
who have heard what hath been said upon this
subject; some, I hope, who are wise towards God
understanding the things that appertain to their
everlasting peace, and such, I am sure, cannot but
acknowledge the truth of what they have heard.
Others, I fear, may be wise enougli for the world,

best advantage, and how to make a good bargain as
well as the best; and such can hardly be persuaded
that they are fools in anything, because they think
themselves to be wise in some things. To such my
humble advice is, that you would seriously weigh
what ye have heard, and not suffer yourselves to be
fooled into a vain conceit of your own wisdom ; for
assure yourselves there is not the ignorantest person
in the congregation that fears God, but is far wiser
than the w^isest of you that do not; for such a one's
little knowledge is true wisdom, your great cunning
is your real folly ; and therefore, if you would mani-
fest yourselves for the future to be wise and prudent
persons indeed, lay aside your former follies, and
devote yourself wholly to the fear and service of
Almighty God, for till you do so, you have not at-
tained to the very first degree of wisdom, ' for the
fear of the Lord is the bef^inninir of wisdom.' " *
It may be that these words seem but cold and
feeble when repeated in this day by other lips ; but
I am persuaded that few could have heard them
spoken by the lips of him who penned them, ani-
mated by the spirit which dwelt within him, without
being, for the moment at least, wiser and better men,
without some resolve forming itself within them,
however transient and evanescent, henceforth to live
less to the world and self, and more to God.

BEVEEIDGE. 107
If we do not propose Beveridge as a model for
imitation, it is because we do not believe that any
preacher can be, in the strict sense of the word, a
model for another; it is because he belongs to an age
with which our own can, at best, have but partial
sympathy. If, however, we look beyond the cir-
cumstances of place and time, if we penetrate to
the life and spirit of the man, then there is hardly
a characteristic of his life or teaching which the
Christian preacher would not do well to imitate.
In his patient toil for the acquisition of sacred
knowledge, in the entire devotion of his heart and
soul and life to the service of God, in his deep
realisation of the Divine presence and grace, in his
fervent love for souls, in the manly simplicity of his
language, in the subordination of all his teaching to
the salvation of men and the glory of God, he is
worthy of earnest study and imitation. Happy will
it be for the Church of England when she has many
preachers and pastors like William Beveridge ; still
more happy when she has multitudes of children
who thankfully receive such teaching and submit to
such guidance!

As the life and death of each separate coral insect
adds to the noiseless growth of the reef, which ulti-
mately becomes an island or a continent, so does the
life and death of each individual man add its per-
manent quota to those vast accumulations of ex-
perience and impulse which determine the conditions
of humanity. He and his work may seem alike to
perish; but just as no particle of matter can be
destroyed, but only be caught up in the magic eddy

of nature to be recombined in new forms with other
elements;—and just as no force can be finally ex-
hausted, but remains impressed for ever on the
material universe;—so even the obscurest man who
has ever lived has exercised a real influence, be it
ever so infinitesimal, on the mighty whole of the
human race. Some men have directed the great
movements which alter the relations of kingdoms;
some men have materially modified the physical
conditions of the globe; some men, by their inven-
tions, have given new developments to the aims and
labours of mankind—have, by their works of art,
haunted our imagination, or by their writings en-
riched our thoughts. But, among all tliese, none
have a stronger claim to universal gratitude than
those Saints of God who have kindled their names
like beacon-lights upon the hills, to show to what
lofty regions the foot of man can reach, what pure
air the life of man can breathe. Others have im-
proved the conditions of living; these have enhanced
the blessedness of life itself. Others have brightened
the gloom of things seen and temporal ; these have
fixed our hearts on the things unseen and eternal.
And such was he of whom I am to-day bidden to
speak. The transcendent merit of Thomas Wilson,
Bishop of Sodor and Man, is that in an age of god-
lessness he was pre-eminently a Saint of God. He
was not a man of genius; he was not a man of great

attainments ; tie was not a man of keen sagacity; he
was not a remarkable orator; he was not a dis-
tinguished author; but he was something higher
and better tban if he had been all these at once, for
he was " the last survivor," if not " of the saints," *
yet certainly of the saints of the English Church—
the last of those too few in number, in our Reformed
Communion, ou whom tliat glorious title can be
bestowed.
Thomas Wilson was born of humble but pious
parentage, at ISTeston in Cheshire, in the year 1663.
He was educated at Chester, and entered the Uni-
versity of Dublin, at the age of eighteen, with a
sizarship of £20 a year. In the same term was
entered a boy of fourteen, whose name was Jonathan
Swift. It is a tradition that they knew each other,
and that, in after years, the Bishop of Sodor and
Man declined a present of some of his works from
the Dean of St. Patrick's.* But what a contrast was
there between the careers and characters of these
two youths! The one a man of colossal genius,
destined to become an intense politician, a scathing
satirist, a terrific pamphleteer, with all the fame of
those who mould the policy of empires; and yet the
most miserable of men ; doomed to break the hearts
of those that loved him—to be lacerated by a savage
indignation, which vented itself in raging sarcasm—
to pollute the sacred page of literature with mis-

anthropy and filth ; a man who had fought with the
wild beasts of fury, and envy, and want, and hate,
and who bore in every limb the bleeding marks of
the horrid contest; a man who seems ever to have
heard, around his head, the scream of malignant
harpies, and the convulsive flap of their obscene
funereal wings, and who, '' dying at the top like a
blighted tree," expired at last in agony and madness,
" a driveller and a show." The other, a man of very
modest capacity, of small literary influence, of no
political weight; who lived, not in the blaze of fame
and publicity, but in the deep valley and shadow of re-
tirement ;—but whose character was one of heavenly
sweetness; whose whole labours were for the good of
his fellow-men; who loved and honoured them as
sincerely as Swift despised and loathed; who broke
no loving hearts, but bound up many a wounded
one; and who, not tormented as Swift was by the
horrors of memory, and so " dying in a rage like a
poisoned rat in a hole," * passed aw^ay amid the tears
of sorrowing thousands, and carried his white hairs,
like a crown of glory, to a happy and a deeply
honoured grave. Could two careers of schoolfellows
be more different ?—the one like a glaring meteor,
plunging through storm and the wrath of the elements
into the twilight, into the evening, into the black
dark night; the other a sweet and shining dawn,
that brightened more and more unto the perfect day.

WILSON. 113
After a blameless but undistinguished college
career, in the year 1686 Wilson was ordained : and
the exquisite prayer which lie yearly used on the
anniversary of his ordination,—" Give me, 0 Lord
God, I humbly beg, a sober, a patient, an under-
standing, a devout, a religious, and courageous
heart. . . ." *—may serve as an epitome of the spirit
of his life. In the same year he was appointed
curate of New Church, on £30 a year, and from that
time, if not before, he always, to the end of his life,
set aside one-tenth of his income for the poor. In
1692 he became chaplain to Lord Derby, and tutor
to his son. Lord Strange. We know from history
how low was the position of domestic chaplains, and,
indeed, of the clergy generally, in the eighteenth
century, and how basely complaisant was too often
their tone and conduct; and I fear that there were
very few among them who would have shown the
courage which Mr. Wilson did, in venturing to drop
hot sealing-wax on Lord Strange's hand when he
was about to sign a document which he had not
read, and even to rebuke his noble patron for ex-
travagance and neglect of his affairs. There, too,
he first set to his age the rare example of re-
fusing to hold a living at which he could not
reside.!    So far from resenting his manly rebuke,

Lord Derby,  the very next year, compelled  him,
in  spite   of his   most   sincere   nolo   e^piscopari,   to
become Bishop of Sodor and Man.    It was so poor a
bishopric * that all Wilson's predecessors had been
only too glad to supplement its poverty by an Eng-
lish benefice ;   but Wilson, on being again offered
the living of Badworth, in Yorkshire, again set to a
corrupt and worldly Church the higher example of
refusing it—" strange and highflown " as his scruples
must then have seemed.    Accordingly he was made
Doctor of Laws by Archbishop Tenison, consecrated
Bishop, and in 1698, after a sail which occupied four
days, landed in the little diocese where he was to
rule for   no  less than  eight-and-fifty years.     The
prayer which he wrote on April 11, 1G98, the day of
his enthronement, is well worth study, as showing
alike the spirit on which he entered upon his new
and sacred duties, and the spirit in which, by God's
help, he was enabled to fulfil them to the last, t

witli no thoughts of gloom and discontent—it was
not only with no desire for preferment in England,
but even with a determination not to take it,—that
Bishop Wilson lauded in his little Patmos. He
meant to make this his home, there to live and there
to die. There he married, there his children were
born, and there he lived for fifty years a widower.
He threw himself with love and diligence into all his
duties. He preached, he visited, he practised a free
and genial hospitality; he indulged his benevolent
heart in the largest charity; he built; he planted;
he restored churches; he improved the agriculture
of the island; he promoted parochial libraries; he
made efforts to found colleges, and elevate the theo-
logical standard of his clergy; he drew up the
' Principles and Duties of Christianity,'the first book
in the Manx language ; he laboured in season and
out of season, and won the love of all good and
honest men. Even in his brief visits to England he
supported charity schools at a time when they were

then begs for "a House and
Prebend att Wiuchester," or
something similar, to prevent
the necessity of his wintering in
the severe clime of Man, because
he has " a title too bigge for his
scant fortunes to maintain;" and
again he speaks of Bishopscourt
as "a disconsolate residence,"
and describes " the terrible
storms, tempests, and prodigious
winds and inundations of rayne

immortal honour, among the earliest founders of
institutions so excellent as the Societies for the
Propagation of the G-ospel, and tlie Promotion of
Christian Knowledge. But his main work, and his
constant residence, was at Bishopscourt. Tuta et
parvula—" safe and very small"—was the motto in
which he described his little diocese, and to which he
remained faithful to the end.*
And let it not be supposed for a moment that
he was influenced by so ignoble a motive as love of
ease. The little island was much more of a thistle
than a rose. Its bleak atmosphere, its scanty popu-
lation, its ignorant clergy, its deep poverty, its entire
isolation, might have been easily borne by one whose
sole aim in life was faithfully to cultivate the little
corner of the vineyard which God had entrusted to
him. But this was far from all. Bishop Wilson was
a High Churchman with a sincere belief in ecclesi-
astical discipline, and this discipline he carried out

humble, saintly as it was — are yet inexpressibly
dreary. They consist mainly of the miserable details
of provincial vice among both clergy and people—a
tissue of small crimes, disagreeably diversified by
large ones—together with the warnings, penances,
and excommunications which these entailed. People
are censured, admonished, and have to give security
even for offences so venial as not going to church, or
for sleeping in church,* and there is a quite incessant
' doing of penance in white sheets, j There was a
bridle, of which a specimen is still preserved, to gag
people guilty of abuse and slander ; and instead of
being, as in England, whipped at the cart's tail,
certain offenders were dragged through the water by
soldiers at the stern of a boat. It is hardly to be
wondered at that the energetic enforcement of a
rapidly obsolescing system—even by a man so saintly
and tender that he mingled his tears with those of
the offenders whom he condemned—gradually aroused
an organised opposition.f    I do not propose to detail

pray for his enemies, and labour at the translation
of the Manx Bible. At last he managed to lodge an
appeal with the Privy Council, was released, and

offered him in indemnification. In these struo'Sfles
with the petty pelting officers of the place—hun-

—a lonely widower, a bereaved father, amid inces-
sant annoyances and shameful calumnies, lie passed
long years. Amid such a paltry environment of
provincial malignities there is absolutely nothing
beautiful but this good man's life, who, *' being con-
vinced that he was no proprietor " (oh that all Eng-

only a steward of the Church's patrimony, and find-
ing by experience that God would be no man's
debtor," was for years putting by forty per cent, of
his income, for pious uses in his own diocese and
among the poor.*
More peaceful days came at last, and a scene or
two is illustrative both of tlie man and of the time.
The Bishop was at Court, and when he had kissed
the King's hand,—" Nobody," said the Queen to her
ladies, *' envies that honest man his bishopric."
" Nor do I envy any one theirs," said he. " I be-
lieve you," said Queen Caroline; '* you are a very
honest man."
"See here, my lords," said the Queen (on
another occasion), when she had several prelates
with her, "is  a  bishop  who  does  not care for a

jesty," said he, " I will not leave my wife in my
old age because she is poor." Even the heart of
George II. was won by such transparent goodness.
"The Bishop came into the drawing-room in his
usual simple dress, having a small black cap on the
top of his liead, with his hair flowing and silvery, and
Ids shoes fastened, like those of an ancient Manxman,
with leathern thongs instead of buckles. As soon as
he entered the [)reseuce-chamber, the King stepped
out of the circle of his courtiers, and advancing to-
wards the Bishop, came to him, took him by the
hand, and said, " i^Iy lord, I beg your prayers."
His latter days were spent almost exclusively in
the duties of his diocese ; and it was in his own
house at Bishopscourt that finally, in his ninety-
third year, gentle sickness came upon him, and
gradual decay. In his last days all was calm and
beautiful. God gave him songs in the night. From
that time to the hour of his death the very wan-
derings of his delirium were praise and prayer.
There was a beauty and dignity about his look and
manner which impressed every beliolder with awe;
and he died as he had lived, with holy words upon
his lips.

It is, however, as a Preacher that we have now to
do with him, audit is his position as a Preacher that
I wish mainly to define. And I must say at once that,
in a literary point of view, his Sermons can hardly
be held up as a remarkable model of style, of method,
or even of theologic thought. Little more can be
said of them than that his style is very plain, his
method exceedingly simple, and his religious opin-
ions unquestioningly orthodox. They contain so little
that is specially rememberable, that the Bishop
preached them again and again, over a space of
fifty-eight years, with scarcely a word of alteration,
and even " in the same words to the same audiences
at no long spaces of time."t  And if this shows " how

small scruple he had in repeating himself, and how
little he cared to be original in teaching men their
duty," it shows also that his Sermons owed very little
to the emotions of the moment, and that he did not
in the least desire to create those delicate and in-
tense impressions which can be produced but once
by the same utterance on the same minds. It is quite
impossible to imagine such sermons as Jeremy Tay-
lor's "House of Feasting," or South's '' Fall of Man,"*
preached twice over to the same audience. The
glory of images once caught under the fresh sunlight
of the imagination cannot be reproduced, and the
language of fervour must be fresh from the soul, if it
aims at kindling any answering glow. But there is
really no reason why sermons such as those of Bishop
Wilson—plain practical homilies in short simple
paragraphs—should not be preached to the same
audience almost any number of times. In his
' Maxims' and his ^ Sacra Privata' there is a certain
tenderness and sweetness of cadence which almost
constitutes a style, though they have none of the
flowing rhythms of Bishop Andrewes, or the occa-
sional beauties of Bishop Hall, or the poetic richness
of Bishop Jeremy Taylor. They remind us more of
the ' Imitatio Christi'—though devoid of the subtle,
indescribable charm,—the mystic splendour stealing
over the oracular gems—which characterises thatim-

doubtedly inferior to the * Maxims' and the * Sacra
Privata.' If we looked only at their negative cha-
racteristics, we should not value them very highly.
There is not in them all one burst of passion—one
flight of eloquence ; not one striking metaphor; not
one profoundly original thought; not one ilhimina-
tive aspect of duty ; not one deep touch of pathos ;
not one phrase which quivers with the writer's own
emotion; not only " no thoughts that breathe or
words that burn," but scarcely even one graceful
allusion or happy illustration. His utterance is not
the flight of the eagle, but the gliding of the swal-
low, and through the smooth air of his exhortation
" Kadit iter liquidum celeres neque promovet alas." *
For instance, his home was cast for nearly sixty
years in a spot of extreme beauty, where he daily
heard the voices of the mountain and the sea, and
saw the mists shroud the mountain-tops, and through
rents of their w^hite vail caught glimpses of sunset,
and colourings of amazing loveliness. We can well
imagine how many an exquisite and immortal image
such surroundings would have flung on the reflective
mirror of a poetic susceptibility; but, so far as I have

observed, there is not in Wilson's Sermons, from be-
ginning^ to end, one single allusion to the magnificence
or loveliness of the outer world. Nor again, is there
any reference worth speaking of to the great world
of books. The Sermons of the seventeenth century-
divines are rich with the spoils of their oceanic read-
ing, and he who would edit their writings would
need a library coextensive with the learning of that
day : but the editor of Wilson needs little or nothing
beyond a Bible and an Apocrypha. Nor, again, does
he ever refer to that other inestimable revelation, the
Book of History. Some of his mighty predecessors,
using the experience of the past as a mirror to the
present, had laid under contribution the annals of
the world: but the reader of Wilson need hardly be
aware that there has ever been any nation except the
English and the Jews. And, once more, Wilson is
singularly devoid of the faintest reflection on the
circumstances of his day. It was the age of Hume,
yet he does not contribute one iota of argument to
the defence of Christianity : it was the age of Pope,
yet he scarcely quotes or alludes to, one line of
poetry :* it was the age of Addison and Johnson,
yet he makes no reference to contemporary litera-
ture : it was the age of Beekeley and Butler, yet

preaching of Wesley and Whitfield, yet he never
touches upon that breath of reviving influence, which
—alas! too late it may be to avert the Nemesis of her
neglect and worldliness !—was beginning to breathe
over the dead Church like a stream of fire.* From
his early manhood vast events had shaken the king-
dom ; but though he had been twenty-two years okl
at the time of the Bloody Assizes, and had lived
through such crises as the Great Kevolution, the
Massacre of Glencoe, the victories of Marlborough, the
Peace of Utrecht, the accession of the House of Bruns-
wick, and the adventures of Prince Charles Edward—
though he had witnessed careers so varied, so melan-
choly, so instructive as those of many of his illus-
trious contemporaries in a stirring and troublous
epoch—yet there is nothing in his writings to indi-
cate the existence of Jesuits, or Jacobites, or Me-

How is it, then, that Bishop Wilson was un-
doubtedly a great preacher; that so good and fasti-
tidious a judge as Queen Caroline called him her
silver-tongued Bishop; that he was much followed
and admired ; that the various London Societies were
always anxious to secure his advocacy; that he has
even been called " the most perfect Gospel preacher
among uninspired men " ? Why is it that, even in
great English towns, crowds would flock round him,
with the request, " Bless me too, my Lord " ; and that
when " these divine discourses," as one of his clergy
calls them, were preached in Manx after his death,
crowds began to tiock again to the churches which
]Methodisin was beginning to empty ?
I answer first that, though his Sermons were
not great in the way of literary greatness; though
they partake of, and illustrate, that downward move-

and ignorant Deism" was freely prattled in all
fashionable circles, and general scorn of religion was,
as always, attended by general profligacy of man-

labours, and self-indulgent in their lives. There
were some even among leading statesmen who were
drunken, illiterate, and coarse. There were mem-
bers of the Royal Family who set a scandalous
example. The odious letters of Chesterfield show
with what unblushing cynicism a father could teach
immorality to his son as a necessary element of a
fashionable career. The uneducated and shamefully
neglected masses sank into terrible depths of crime
and brutality. The pictures of Hogarth, the novels
of Smollett and Fieldino:, show that Eno^lish morals
had fallen to their very nadir of degradation. And
how did God's ministers attempt to stem this torrent
of iniquity ? what was the teaching they offered,
what the motives they opposed to all this crime and
denial of God ? Nothing, for the most part, but the
coldest and nakedest morality. They were not Pro-
phets ; they were not Seers; they were not even well-
instructed Scribes; they were but cold Essayists and
dull Utilitarians. Their Gospel was a Gospel of bald
respectability. There was no passionate appeal to
the wavering, no fiery denunciation of the insolent
wrong-doer. Cringing flattery, unblushing inconsis-
tency, open worldliness, greedy hunting of prefer-
ments,—Bishops and Archbishops amassing colossal

vinces by the shameless nepotism, which gorged witli
phiralities of every desirable benefice their sons and
kinsmen,—a clergy addicted to such aims as these*—
a clergy painfully anxious to relieve themselves of
the crying sin of enthusiasm,!—a clergy which revel-
led in such pompons euphuisms and polished nullities
as those of Blair, could never deeply stir the heart of
the age. For a living coal from the altar they offered
to their generation a glittering icicle from the study.
They applied feeble sprinklings of tepid water to
an age which needed burning deluges of baptismal
fire. The very conception of a sermon became to
the last degree artificial and inane. " I should think
a clergyman might distinguish himself," said the poet
Shenstone, "' by composing a set of sermons on the
ordinary virtues extolled by the classic writers, in-
troducing the ornamental flourishes of Horace," &c. !
Even Bishops, in their charges, referred their clergy
to the satires of Juvenal,^ instead of bidding them
catch their moral intensity from Isaiah or St. James.

130 CLASSIC  PREACHEES:
The conception of religion had dwindled into a cal-
culating selfishness, and a prudential commonplace.
The current theology is typified by a sermon which
explained the Fatherhood of God as an elegant met-
aphor.* The chief anxiety of the preachers seemed
to be that none should suppose them to be so utterly
foolish as to urge any one to be righteous overmuch.
Enthusiasm ? it needed men who were " boilinGf in
o
spirit "t to continue the work of the Prophets and
the Apostles; it needed a voice of thunder, and a
tongue of fire, to shame into decency, and startle into
repentance this corrupt and guilty age.
2. And though Wilson's was no voice of fire, yet his
2)reaching w^as far above the average teaching of his
age. He has this surpassing merit, that " he never
penned one sentence which savoured of unreality."
Among his contemporaries he shone like a light in
the world. His stylo is exquisitely lucid, and has
a certain dignity and sweetness of its own. If his
sermons have no special force, they have at least an
admirable directness ; and if they have no eloquence,
yet they are not devoid of tenderness and unction.
They assume all Christian doctrine ; they ignore all
speculative theology; but they have these three
marked characteristics:—a very practical aim;   an

intimate knowledge of Scripture; and the peaceful
calm of a most untroubled faith. They do not indeed
glow with an inspiring passion, but they do shine
with a serene and heavenly light. And if they never
soar,—if they have no exordium, no peroration, no
one prevailing all-absorbing motive,—if they never
rise to a climax, or startle by a paradox, or arouse
by an antithesis—yet, on the other hand, they never
sink. They have in them no word of folly, no tinge
of affectation, no shadow of bad taste. They need,
it has been acutely said, to be tested by immediate
translation into action. " To think on Bishop Wilson
with veneration," said Dr. Johnson, " is only to agree
with the whole Christian world. I hope to look into
his books with other purposes than those of criticism,
and after their perusal not only to write but to love
better." Accept them as an authoritative guide to
religious conduct, drawn from deep and lifelong ex-
perience, and then, ceasing to be ordinary, they be-
come sublime. * And this is why one of the acutest
and most genial of modern critics ventures to rank
Eisliop Wilson among the four chief names of the
English Church. " Hooker," he says, " is great, by
having signally and above others the sense in reli-
gion of history and historic development. Butler is
great, by having the sense of philosophy ; Barrow, by
having  that of morals;  AVilson,  that of practical

Christianity."* We may sum up in one word the
excellence of Wilson by saying that, to a pre-
eminent degree, he received the kingdom of God
as a little child.
3. But another source of his power—if, indeed, it
be not the same under another aspect—lay in the
TfOo'^ of the man,—in the deep moral impression
which he made on his hearers.f " His style," said
Mr. Moore, in his Funeral Sermon, " is adapted to
the capacity of all degrees of men: at the same time
he delivered his sentiments with all the dignity and
authority of an insjDired Apostle." Even when the
sermon was poorest, the speaker was a Saint of God.
The lips of such a man, even if he be—as Wilson
was not—of stammering tongue, will speak wisdom.
There were many good men in Wilson's, as in every
age, whose lives have been all the more unnoticed
because they were hid with Christ in God ; but a
Saint is one who makes his religion, absolutely and
Matthew Arnold's ' Lit. and and fervent charity ; his good
sense is so perfect and in such
happy alliance with his unc-
tion that it becomes moderation
and insight."—' Culture and An-
archy,' p. vii.

good, are not always understood
or minded by common people;
but a good, a sober, a pious life
and example, is a language that
everybody understands." — Wil-
son's 'Sermons,' Ixxxix.

attributes to him a balance of
tlie four qualities of ardour, unc-
tion, downright honesty, and
plain good sense, which might
have resulted in a prosaic reli-
gion held fanatically, but which
he possessed in a fulness and
perfection which made this un-
toward result impossible—"his

sense, that it becomes tenderness

inflexibly, and in ways little familiar to his genera-
tion, the rule of his whole life; and who, with a per-
fect absence of all self-consciousness, does this in such
a manner as to seize the imagination and influence
the character of his own and of other generations.
Berkeley and Butler were men of pre-eminent good-
ness, and men of a thousand times the ability of
Ken and Wilson; yet we do think of Ken and
Wilson, and we do not think of Berkeley and
Butler, as saints of God. Living in an age in which
sensuality had eaten like a cancer into the heart
of society, Wilson left on all men the impression of
serene and stainless purity. Living in an age of
greed and worldliness, he chose the lot of self-deny-
ing poverty and voluntary retirement. And so be-
hind the Sermons stood the man. We who only read
those Sermons cannot fairly judge of them. Men
can listen to much which they would find it tedious
to peruse in print; and he, for instance, who can only
judge of Whitfield by his published remains, can
form no conception of the thrilling effect produced
by his impassioned oratory.
" See God's ambassador in pulpit stand
Where they could take note from his look and hand,
And from his speaking action bear away-
More sermon than our preachers use to say."-
And when we find in Wilson's Sermons the simplest
truths of faith and morality set forth with entire
sincerity, in language plain, but reverent, and void
of every tiuge of Pharisaism; when we know that
13-1 CLASSIC  PEEACIIERSo
bis life and his words were in perfect accord; when
we recall in imagination the forehead whereon the
Lamb had set his seal; tlie calm dignity of bearing—
the flowing silver hair—the comely and benevolent
aspect—the sweet and reverent voice—the saintly
and venerable figure—we can well imagine that
none could listen to exhortations such as his—so
faithful, so intelligible, so practical, so scriptural—
without being the better and wiser for them.
" At clmrcli with meek and unaftected grace
His looks adoi'ned the venerable place ;
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,
And fools who came to scoff remained to pray."
And, if many of our great divines have risen to
loftier heights of ability; have left behind them
more immortal utterances; have swayed more
potently the hearts of multitudes; have shed more
light upon the great problems of religion; have
fired with a more ardent enthusiasm the love of
virtue;—yet the life and example of Wilson are a
hei'itage more precious than eloquent words. x\nd so
long as the spirit of religion has any influence upon
mankind (and that surely will be so long as man is
man), so long will his calm good sense, his practical
wisdom, his perfect consistency, his sober-minded
gentleness—in one word, the holiness of his charac-
ter, as preserved for us by a warm and loving me-
morial,—furnish us with a worthy object of love and
imitation in this true servant of the Lord Jesus—

A VOLUME of Sermons, published in the course of
last year,—probably, in knowledge of the human
heart and analysis of human motives, one of the
two greatest contributions to religious literature
which the nineteenth century has made,*—recalls to
us the ethical discourse which has too much gone
out of late, and of which Butler's Sermons are the
great model and archetype. Joseph Butler, Bishop
and Prince Palatine of Durham, is not dead; or
rather, " he being dead, yet speaketh " in the pages
of Professor Mozley. The Professor's great dis-
courses on " The peaceful temper" and on " Our duty
towards equals," and his method of showing how war
is bound up in that distinction of the human race
into nations, which is part of the present system of
things, are conceived in Butler's happiest vein, and
differ from his Sermons chiefly in being much easier
reading, and couched in a style far less ponderous.

But ethical Sermons generally give rise in some
minds to a question, the answer to which will throw
liglit upon the^ true character of preaching, and
may be given, we think, quite ■ suitably from the
pulpit, without any blinking of the sacred objects
which should be paramount there. That Bishop
Butler was a profound religious thinker, and a great
moral philosopher, will be admitted on all hands.
But there are many who would demur to his claim
to rank among great preachers. No doubt he
wrote discourses, which he entitled Sermons, and
which were delivered from the pulpit. These,
however, are but the accidents and accessories of
preaching; and before any person's claims to be a
preacher can be satisfactorily made out, it must
be shown that his discourses are essentialhj sermons,
sermons in something more than the name. In
attempting to do this for Bishop Butler, we shall
gain an insight into the distinguishing character of
his preaching.
Every one understands what is meant when a
sermon and an expository lecture are spoken of as
distinct. But it is doubtful whether the terms em-
ployed represent the real and essential distinction
between the things.*    All preaching is, or ought to
* Probably the more correct
definition would be to call the
sermon an exposition of a single
detached passage of Holy Scrip-
ture, the lecture an exposition
of an entire context with all
the sequences of thought which
link text to text.    In the first

be, expository; that is, it ought to be an exposition
or setting forth of some part of the Word of God.
If any discourse is not this, it is not preaching. And,
conversely, if any part of the Word of God, whether
promise or precept, warning or consohition, forms the
subject of a discourse, it is properly called a sermon,
and the person delivering it is a preacher. But in this
definition the expression, " tlie word of God," must
be understood in its full legitimate breadth of mean-
ing. There is a word of God, for those who have
ears to hear it, in Nature as well as in Kevelation,—
a word not by any means so explicit as Holy Scrip-
ture, but yet which serves sufficiently, as St. Paul
tells us, to render those " without excuse " * w^io do
not heed it; the word of which the Psalmist speaks,
when he says,t " The heavens declare the glory of
God ; and the firmament sheweth his handy work.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor lan-
guage, where their voice is not heard." Now these
works of God, whereby His "eternal power and
godhead "J are understood among men, are not
merely—and one may say not chiefly—outside us.
The noblest work of God is man himself.     Man's
there is more or less unity of
thouglit; in the second there is
no other unity tlian that which
is given by tracing the stages
of the argument, if the passage
is argumentative, or the develop-
ment of the narrative, if it be
historical.

mental and moral anatomy, and its adaptation
to his circumstances and surroundings, bears a
stronger testimony to the Creator's power, wisdom,
and goodness, than even the architecture of the
heavens or the structure of animals. The ex-
pounders, therefore, of the works of God, seeing
that His works are a true revelation of Himself,
though dimmer and less explicit than His word,
may rightfully, if only they point upwards continu-
ally from the creature to the Creator, claim the
title of great preachers. Paley, in his * Natural
Theology,' is a great preacher, his object being to
discover and disclose the traces of an intelligent and
benevolent Creator, w^hich are scattered so thick over
the whole realm of nature. And not less surely—
rather much more—is Butler a magnificent preacher,
whose Sermons discuss and expound that great sub-
ject, which the Apostle lays down * as the foundation-
stone of his argument on the justifying efficacy of
faith, the law " written in the heart," and the " wit-
ness" of conscience. Hence comes the deficiency
of evangelical reference, or rather of reference to
revealed religion, in these Sermons, a fact which
is patent upon the surface of them,t and which to
* See Eom. ii. 15.
t A remarkable instance of
tliis absence of reference to Holy-
Scripture is to be found in
Sermon IX. (" Upon Forgiveness
of Injuries "), where the moral
ground of capital punishment is

guilt or demerit of the criminal
140
CLASSIC  PREACHEKS:
superficial readers, possessed with the conventional
notion of what a sermon is or ought to be, forms
no inconsiderable stumbling-block. Even where one
would most naturally look for them, evangelical allu-
sions are, if I may so say, studiously avoided. Thus
the two great Sermons " Upon the Love of God," that
is, on our love towards Him, do not even incident-
ally and in passing refer to that love of God to-
wards us, which is the great inducing motive of
our love to Him, according to that word of the
Evangelist,* *' We love him, because he first
loved us." While recognising the goodness of God
generally as that which "ought and has a natural
tendency to beget in us the affection of gratitude," f
he is silent as to  that great exhibition of Divine
dispenses with the obh'gation of
good-will, neither would this
justify any severity; but that his
life is inconsistent with the quiet
and happiness of the world: that
is, a general and more enlarged
obligation necessarily destroys a
particular and more confined one
of the same kind, inconsistent
with it" (p. 145). As far as any
mischief goes, which the culprit
himself might hereafter do, the
world would be sufficiently
secured against it by his per-
petual imprisonment. Hence
what Butler must have meant is
that, unless the extreme penalty
were exacted from the criminal,
there would be no sufficient de-
terrent against crimes of the
same order. But what we wish
to draw attention to is the entire
omission of any relerence to the
Divine authorization of capital
punishment as inflicted by the
magistrate, both in tlie Noachic
precejit (Gen. ix, 6), and in the
New Testament, where the capi-
tal punisliment is not restricted
to the offence of blood-shedding
(Eom. xiii. 4). " The sword "
placed in the hand of the civil
magistrate was a symbol of his
being invested with the power
of life and death.

goodness, the gift of God's Son for and to sinners, the
comfortable pledge to us, as the Apostle teaches,* of
His readiness to bestow all lower and lesser gifts. It
is almost as if, in saying the General Thanksgiving,
a man should stop short after the words, " We bless
Thee for onr creation, preservation, and all the bless-
ings of this life," and should drop all the subsequent
mention of the " inestimable love " manifested in re-
demption, of the " means of grace," and of'' the hope
of glory."
The omission is far too strongly marked to be
attributed to aught else but deliberate design.
Butler intended his treatment of the love of God to
be, like the rest of his Sermons, purely and exclu-
sively moral. " Then why," it might be asked,
" take up such a subject at all ? Why not let tlie
Sermons ' Upon Human Nature,' ' The Government
of the Tongue,' and other purely moral subjects,
stand alone, without intruding into the domain of
Theology by a disquisition upon the love of God ? "
The answer is, that it is assumed throughout the
Sermons that the being and attributes of God are
recognisable by the light of reason and conscience,!
* See Rom. viii. 32.
t See Serm. I. p. 11, where lie
mentions certain " instances of
our Maker's care and love both

cies ;" Serm. II. p. 26, " Instincts

tion, man cannot be considered
as a creature left by his Maker
to act at random;" Serm. IV.

142
CLASSIC  PREACHEES:
quite apart from the more brilliant light which
revealed religion sheds upon them. Butler will
not avail himself, in the smallest degree, of that
more brilliant light. His design is to show that the
morality of the Gospel, wliich turns upon the two
principal pivots of the love of God and the love of
our neighbour, is indicated in the structure of human
nature, when it is closely analysed. If the heart of
man, truly read and interpreted, is found to make a
most distinct and intelligent echo to the twofold
precept of the love of God and of our neighbour,
that furnishes a very strong presumption that this
summary of morality is from   the Author  of our
necessaries, but also enjoyment
and satisfaction;" Serm. XIV.
p. 243, "Our reason convinces
us that God is present witli us,
and we see and feel the effects
of his goodness;" ibid. p. 252,
" Since the supreme Mind, the
Author and Cause of all things,
is the highest possible object to
himself, he may be an adequate
supply to all the faculties of our
souls;"—and the Sermons " upon
the Love of God " 'passim.
It will be remembered that the
great religious controversy of
Butler's days was with the
Deists (Collins, Toland, Tindal,
Chubb, &c.) who admitted the
being and attributes of God.
Mr. Leslie Stephen, in liis ' His-
tory of English Thought in the
Eighteenth   Century'   [London,
1876], seems to think the lucu-
brations of the Deists one of the
most important factors in the
serious thought of that age. An
able paper in the ' Quarterly
Review' for April 1877, calls in
question the importance of the
Deistical speculations then so
rife; but of course these specu-
lations must have been constantly
present to the theologians of the
day; and when they wrote con-
troversially or apologetically,
Ihey would feel that by the
greater part of the religious
thinkers of the day no objection
would be made to their assuming
as true the first paragrajDh of
the Apostles' Creed, however
prevalent might be the scepti-
cism respecting the second and
third.

nature. It is an independent testimony to Gospel
morality which Butler is seeking to elicit from his
researches into the human heart; and in order to do
this, he is bound to refrain from advancing any truth
of revealed religion, which natural religion does
not of itself establish. Thus his argument de-
manded the banishment of evangelical topics. But
let us not do this great and good divine the crying
injustice of supposing that such topics did not sit
very near his heart. The prelate who, in compli-
ance with his own principle of the benefit accruing
from public expressions of faith,* set up in that cold
and rationalizing age the emblem of our redemp-
tion in the chapel of his palace at Bristol, and was
defamed and vilified as a Papist f in consequence,
as many smaller men than he have been since his
day on no better or more reasonable ground, can
never have been wanting in appreciation of that re-
demption, which was wrought upon the cross, and
of which the cross is the symbol.
* " Your chief business, there-
fore, is to endeavour to beget a
practical sense of it" [religion]
"upon their hearts .... And
this is to be done by keeping up,
as we are able, the form and face
of religion with decency and re-
verence, and in such a degree as
to bring the thoughts of religion
often to their minds. . . . Ex-
ternal acts of piety and devotion,
and the frequent returns of them,
are necessary, to keep up a sense
of religion, which the affairs of
the world will otherwise wear

144
CLASSIC  PREACHEES:
Following ill the line of thought which has been
thus opened, we will first speak of these Sermons
in their more obvious character as evidential, and
then regard them as expositions of certain great
and fundamental truths of Holy Scripture.
I. And in speaking of them as evidential, our
first observation is that they are something more
than evidential, that the same argument which
serves the purpose of confuting selfish and sceptical
theories, is made to serve equally well the moral
purpose of enforcing duty upon the professed be-
liever. A little above a parallel was drawn betw^een
Paley and Butler, as being both of them expositors
of that lower revelation which God has made of
Himself in the works of nature—Paley dealing with
the works which lie around and outside of man,

But if Paley may, in regard of his ' Natural Theo-

tongue* of the woodpecker, in tlie foott of the water-
depended upon the superior sen-
sibility of the retina; that is,
upon its being affected by the
most feeble impulses. But that
tenderness of structure which
rendered the membrane thus ex-
quisitely sensible, rendered it
also liable to be offended by the
access of stronger degrees of
light. The contractile range
therefore of the pupil is in-
creased in these animals, so as
to enable them to close the aper-
ture entirely, which includes the
power of diminishing it in every
degree; whereby at all times
such portions, and only such por-
tions, of light are admitted as
may be received without injury
to the sense." (Paley's ' Natu-
ral Theology;' Loudon, 1802;

* " The tongue of the wood-
pecker is one of those singulari-
ties which nature presents us
with, when a singular purpose
is to be answered. It is a parti-
cular instrument for a particulnr
use; and what else but design
ever produces such ? The wood-
pecker lives chiefly upon insects,
lodged in the bcdies of decayed
or decaying trees. For the pur-
pose of boring into the wood, it
is furnished with a bill, straight,
hard, angular, and sharp. "When,
by means of this piercer, it has
reached the cells of the insects,
then   comes   the   office   of  its
[ST. James's.]
tongue; which tongue is, first, of
such a length that the bird can
dart it out three or four inches
from the bill, in this respect
differing greatly from every other
species of bird; in the sec( ^nd
place, it is tipped with a stiff,
sharp, bony thorn; and, in the
third place, which appears to me
the most remarkable property of
all, this tip is dentated on both
sides, like the beard of an arrow
or the barb of a hook. The
description of the part declares
its use. The bird, having ex-
posed the retreats of the insects
by the assistance of its bill, witli
a motion inconceivably quick
launches out at them with this
long tongue; transfixes them
upon the barbed needle at the
end of it; and tlius draws its
prey within its mouth. If this be
not mechanism, what is ? Should
it be said, that, by continual
endeavours to shoot out the
tongue to the stretch, the wood-
pecker species may by degrees
have lengthened the organ itself,
beyond that of other birds, what
account can be given of its form,
of its tip ? How, in particular,
did it get its barbs, its dentation ?
These barbs, in my opinion,
wherever they occur, are deci-
sive proofs of mechanical con-
trivance." (' Natural Theology,'
chap. xiii. 268-270.)

pursue the consideration further,
I should take in that generic
distinction among birds, the web-
foot of water-fowl. It is an in-
stance whicli may be pointed
out to a child. The utility of
the web to water-fowl, the inu-
tility to land-fowl, are so obvious,
that it seems impossible to notice
the difference without acknow-
ledging the design. I am at a
loss to know how those who deny
the agency of an intelligent
Creator dispose of this example.
There is nothing in the action
of swimming, as carried on by a
biid upon the surface of the
water, that should generate a
membrane between the toes. As
to that membrane, it is an exer-
cise of constant resistance. The
only supposition I can think of
is, that all birds have been origi-
nally water-fowl and web-footed ;
that sparrows, hawks, linnets,
&c., which frequent the land,
Jiave, in process of time, and in
the course of many generations,
had this part worn away by
treading upon hard ground. To
such evasive assumptions must
atheism always have recourse;
and, after all, it confesses that
the structure of the feet of birds,
in their original form, was criti-
cally adapted to their original
destination."    ('Natural  Theo-
logy,' chap. xii. pp. 255, 256.)
* *' If the reader, looking to
our distrilaitions of science, wish
to contemplate the chemistry, as
well as the mechanism of nature,
the insect  creation will  afford
him an example.    I refer to the
light in the tail of a glow-worm.
Two points seem to be agreed
upon by naturalists concerning
it:  first, that it is phosphoric;
secondly, that its use is to attract
the male insect.  The only thing
to be inquired after is the singu-
larity, if any such there be, iu
the natural history of this animal,
which should render a provision
of this kind more necessary for
it than fur other insects.     That
singularity seems to be the dif-
ference which  subsists between
the male and the female, which
difference is greater than what
I we find in any other species of
animal  whatever.     The   glow-

Paley's argument stands clear altogether of human
duty, yields no indications of what man's character
and conduct should be, unless, indeed, it be tlie
inference that to a Being so wise, so powerful, so
good, man owes adoration, praise, and gratitude.
But not so Butler's argument on the internal eco-
nomy of the human heart. When he vindicates a
place among the principles of our nature for bene-
corapanion in the air. The
winged rover disdains the ojround.
They might never, therefore, be
brought together, did not this
radiant torch direct the volatile
mate to his sedentary female."
('Works of W. Paley, D.D.'
London : 1821. Vol. iv. p. 2t53.)
Of course in thus citing Paley,
whose works (like those of But-
ler himself) it is now the fashion
ungenerously to depreciate, I am
not ignorant that it will be ob-
jected that the argument from
final causes has had its dnj, and
is going out, and that to appeal
to it, when it is on 'the wane, is
just to ignore the discoveries
made (or alleged to be made) by
modern savants. But my firm
persuasion is that no attempt
(however subtle and ingenious)
permanently to supplant the
argument from design will suc-
ceed in the long run, or take
hold of the public mind. It is
rooted in the common-sense of
manhind; and though a few
philosophers (or would-be philo-
sophers) will from time to time
find an agreeable diversion in
criticising and picking holes in
it, it will crop up again after
they have left the scene, and by
its vitality defy its assailants.
We may safely challenge any
one to succeed in persuading the
great majority of men that where
there is a complete and curious
adaptation of any natural object
to a certain end, it is not due to
an intelligent design in a con-
structive Mind, but only to tlie
operation of a natural instinct in
the object itself. Let savants
say what they please to throw
doubt upon this; their specula-
tions will all go for nothing in the
long run. Or rather, perhaps,
men will make upon them the
reflection which Butler makes
upon the subject of certain fan-
tastic moral theories : " Persons
of superior capacity and improve-
ment have often fallen into
errors, which no one of mere
common understanding could."
(Serm. V. p. 84.)

volence or good-will towards our neighbour—a prin-
ciple which rests in our neighbour's happiness as its
end—and shows that because this " benevolence,
though natural in man to man, yet is in a very low
degree, kept down by interest and competitions ; and
men, for the most part, are so engaged in the busi-
ness and pleasures of the world, as to overlook and
turn away from objects of misery;" therefore com-
passion is also given us, to back up benevolence in
case of the distressed, " to gain the unhappy admit-
tance and access, and to make their case attended
to ;" when he points out the correspondence of com-
passion with our circumstances as placed in a world
of sorrow, and where men have much more power
of doing mischief to one another than good; when
he scatters to the winds the over-subtle tlieories of
the selfish philosophers, that benevolence is nothing
more than delight in the exercise of power, and
compassion nothing more than fear for ourselves in
disguise,—he not only brings evidence to the wisdom
and beneficence of the Creator, but also elicits from
our nature an independent testimony to the morality
of the Gospel, which is said in various parts of Holy
Scripture to be all summed up in love. And this
indication of the path in which our nature, as well
as Scripture, indicates that our duty lies, passes in
Butler's hands into an admonition to walk in that
path, into a plain pressing home of duty upon the
conscience.    So that besides finding footsteps of the
BUTLER. 149
Creator in the structure of the mind, we find also
footsteps for our own conduct in daily life, and foot-
steps in which the preacher exhorts us to plant our
feet. And this is what Butler himself says in the
following passage, which is quite in his own terse
and solid manner:—" As all observations of final
causes, drawn from the principles of action in the
heart of man, compared with the condition he is
placed in, serve all the good uses w^hich instances of
final causes in the material world about us do; and
both these are equally proofs of wisdom and design
in the Author of nature: so the former serve to
further good purposes; they show us what course of
life we are made for, what is our duty, and in a
peculiar manner enforce upon us the practice of it."*
Before taking leave of this part of the subject, it
may be allowable to express the wish that Butler's
Sermons, considered as a great argument, not only
in favour of the wisdom and beneficence of the
Creator, but also in corroboration of Christian mora-
lity, should be recast by some competent person,
and reproduced with amplifications and additions in
a popular form. Butler's style, though it has a
massive grandeur and solidity in it—the just expres-
sion of the author's mind, and dear, if it were only
as a memorial of him, to those who owe him an
intellectual and moral debt of gratitude—is yet any-

thing but attractive to the general reader. The
weighty thoughts are too tersely ennnciated; and
though here and there an almost grim stroke of
sarcastic humour * lights up the page, there is very
little light beyond this. It is probable that from the
fact of the mass of men being so outward, so little apt
to reflect upon themselves and the processes of their
own minds, Butler's ' Natural Morality' (if we may
so term it) could never be made as interesting to
the many as Paley's ' Natural Theology.' But we
cannot but think that something might be done
towards the popularising of so important an apolo-
getic work by one who had first himself obtained
an insight into, and a thorough grasp of the argu-
ment. The Sermons want cohesion and method;
they are all rather essays towards a great moral
theory than the orderly development of one.    And
The 'Quarterly' reviewer of tradict its own end," he prefaces
Mr. Leslie Stephen's book on j the discussion thus: " These in-

this might at least be redressed. What a treatise
might have been added to the apologetic literature
of the Church, had such a writer as Archbishop
Whately recast in his own mind the argument of
these grand Sermons, and expressed it with his own
luminousness and perspicuity!
II. But it is quite possible to bring these Sermons
strictly under the category of Sermons by regarding
them as masterly expositions of certain great truths
of Holy Scripture.
(1.) And first of that statement, which stands at
the head of the inspired history of the human
race: " And God said, Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness .... So God created man
in his own image, in the image of God created he
him." * That Butler himself regarded his studies
of Human Nature in this light, although he nowhere
professes a formal exposition of the text just quoted,
is evident from the following observations, which
are made incidentally. After a powerful discourse
upon Besentment, in which he vindicates for that
passion its place and functions in the moral system,
shows, e.g., that it is a " balance to the weakness of
pity," which, if not thus held in check, would render
the execution of justice upon criminals " exceedingly
difficult and uneasy,"—he concludes with this re-
flection : " Men may speak of the degeneracy and
corruption of the world, according to the experience

152
CLASSIC  PREACHERS:
they liave had of it; but human nature, considered
as tlie Divine workmanship, should methinks be
treated as sacred: for in the image of God made He
man" And in a long note to his first Sermon,
having exposed the unsoundness of Hobbes's theory
that every appearance of good-will and benevolence
which presents itself in human nature, is resolvable
into the love of power, and delight in the exercise of
it, he adds: " These are the absurdities which even
men of capacity run into, when they have occasion
to belie their nature, and will perversely disclaim
that image of God which was originally stamped
upon it, the traces of which, however faint, are
plainly discernible upon the mind of man." Butler's
method of treating this great subject cannot be
thoroughly understood without considering the way
in which he was led to it. It is to be remembered
that he found a selfish theory of morals exclusively
in possession of the field of thought, a theory which
it was fashionable for the sceptical fops of the reign
of George II. to affect, and which gave them a con-
venient plea for their own cynical Epicureanism, and
for disregarding the interests and feelings of tlieir
neighbour to any extent. "Vain, luxurious, and
selfish effeminacy," says a contemporary,* " was the

the Manners and Principles of

chief character of the age," and it was built upon an
erroneous philosophy which derived its whole pres-
tige from liaving been broached by Hobbes and other
writers, whose vie^vs it was accounted a mark of
advanced intelligence and higher cultivation to
adopt. " Vices and follies liave their turns," says
Butler, "and the distinctive vice and folly of the
present day is to profess a contracted spirit, and
greater regards to self-interest than appears to have
been done formerly." And again, in his Preface :
*' There is a strange affectation in many people of
explaining away all particular affections, and repre-
senting the whole of life as nothing but one con-
tinued exercise of seli-love." Now Butler's enterprise
was to explode the false theory under which the
selfishness and cynical indifference of his age veiled
itself, to vindicate human nature from the calumnies
which this theory put upon it, and to show, without
the aid of Kevelation, from a simple and not over
subtle analysis of it, that it was made originally in
the image of God. This, we conceive, he has done
triumphantly, in such a way as to set the question at
once and for ever at rest. And what, it may be
asked, are the traces of this image of God as dis-
covered in human nature ? " We have no clear
conception," says Butler, " of any positive moral
attribute in the Supreme Being but what resolves
itself up into goodness " or benevolence. Now it is
just the natural feeling of benevolence, the existence
154 CLASSIC  PKEACHERS:
of which in man's heart had been called in question
by the selfish philosophy of Butler's day. It is
therefore this point which he labours to establish,
showing* the reality of the feeling, and the impossi-
bility of resolving it, without coming to an absurdity,
into any form of self-love, and pointing out how the
gratification of it is so far from being inconsistent
with self-love, that it is one of the highest and purest
enjoyments known to us ; how, in order to secure it
from being ousted by competition from other prin-
ciples, it is subsidised and seconded by compassion;
and how conscience, in the survey of our actions,
reflects with complacency upon those done from its
promptings, and sets upon benevolence the seal of
its approval. Now we are distinctly told—in the
Scriptures—told twice over by way of emphasizing
an assertion of such paramount importance, that
" God is love."* And we know also (the whole Bible
from beginning to end is a gradual unfolding of the
great truth) that when sin made its entrance into the
world, and blighted the hearts and hopes of men,
this love of God took the aspect of compassion or
mercy towards the sinner. The Gospel in all its
provisions, whether for the acceptance of man with
God, or for his renewal after the image of Him who
created him, is a scheme of Divine mercy. And
yet we are constantly assured that this scheme con-

tributes, as no other arrangement could have done,
to God's own glory, and that the hallowing of His
name—the universal acknowledgment of Him on the
part of all His rational creatures as a most tender
Father, w^ho yet loves His children too well and
wisely to suffer sin upon them—is the end of ends
which is to be pursued by all His rational creatures,
both in prayer and endeavour, and which therefore
must be an end with Himself. And the trace of
this in the moral economy of man is what Butler
has so thoughtfully and carefully pointed out; the
perfect consistency of benevolence with reasonable
self-love, which last he fully admits (and indeed
asserts) to be one of the higher principles of our
nature, and a principle by which, according to the
constitution of that nature, we cannot but be, and
ought to be, strongly influenced. Tliere is this
consistency also in the Divine Mind. Tlie Heavenly
Father finds His greatest delight and blessedness.
His glory and His joy, in re-admitting sinners to full
communion with Himself, through that Mediator
whose precious work of atonement proclaims His holi-
ness, and justice, and truth, with no less emphasis
than His long-suffering, His mercy, and His love.
I say His holiness, and justice, and truth; for when
Butler says that " we have no clear conception of
any positive moral attribute in the Supreme Being,
but what may be resolved up into goodness," we
must take him as meaning exactly what he says;
156 CLASSIC  PREACHERS I
not that there are no other features in the Divine
character but goodness, but that all its other features
are resolvable into this. " God is love;" but He is
liglit, and truth, and holiness, and justice, yea, and
moral indignation also: only none of these attributes
is so fundamental as love—each of them is ultimately
resolvable into love. Sunliofht is found, when ana-
lysed, to comprise sombre as well as bright rays—
indigo, blue, and violet, as well as red, yellow, orange
and green ; the indigo ray is an element in the light
no less than the yellow. The remissness of a
government in punishing obstinate and hardened
criminals, the letting such characters loose upon
society, and putting the lives and properties of the
innocent at their disposal, would not be benevolence
or love to the public,—would not be care for the
general good, but the reverse. And on the other
hand, the making an example of offenders, and
visiting them with condign punishment, though it
does not bear the aspect of love to them, yet does
not imply the least ill-will to them, and is clearly
enough resolvable into benevolence to the public and
care for the general good. Butler shows that " when
benevolence is said," in the Scriptures, " to be the
sum of virtue, it is not spoken of as a blind propen-
sion, but as a principle in reasonable creatures, and
so to be directed by their reason," in order that it
may attain its end, which end he points out as being
not always the avoiding of inconvenience to indivi-

duals, or even classes, but " tlie greatest public
good."—It may be added that truth also,—tliouij^h,
like any one of the seven prismatic rays in light, it
may be looked at separately and distinctly, and must
be so by creatures like ourselves, whose minds must
take a subject to pieces in order to comprehend it,—
is yet resolvable into love or goodness. Suppose a
man, either by words or his method of action, to
raise expectations in the minds of others which his
conduct towards them entirely disappoints, is that
goodness or the reverse ?* The Scribes and Pharisees
were men whose whole life was a lie, who cloaked a
worldly heart under the appearance of piety—tliey
" for a pretence made long prayers." And side by side
with this feature of character, this want of truth, was
a want of love which was the radical or fundamental
vice in them; " they devoured widows' houses."
The sum of what has been said above is, that as
love embraces all the perfections of the Divine na-
ture, so also benevolence, or the love of our neigh-
bour, embraces the whole compass of human duty,
according to that saying of the Apostle's, which
forms the text of Butler's two sermons upon the love

recent volume of ' Lectures on j 25), " Putting away lying,

of her age"), brings out most
forcibly the connexion of truth
with love, in commenting upon
neighbour: for we are members
one of another." Truth is a part
of our duty to our neighbour.
Our whole duty to him is love.

of our neighbour: *' And if there be any other
commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as

Before passing on, we may pause to make an
obvious suggestion, which opens a wide field for use-
ful and edifying thought. What the various attri-
butes of the Divine Being are in themselves is a
problem which, as being high above out of our reach,
we should, from a feeling of reverence, and under a
consciousness of our own utter ignorance, decline all
attempt to solve. The Holy Scriptures, accommo-
dating themselves to our understanding and condi-
tion, speak of the Almighty as moved by compassion,
anger, sorrow, joy, repentance, and other emotions in
our nature; and our wisdom is to take these expres-
sions with all the simplicity of children, and act in
conformity with the representations thus given to us
of the character of Him with whom we have to do.
That such representations are not mere figures of
speech, that there is something underlying them, of
which the terms expressive of human passions are
the correct exponents to our minds, is clear from the
circumstance that, when God took flesh " and was
made man," He assumed all human affections, and
through the medium of those affections exhibited to
us the image of the invisible God.    Highly interest-

ing and profitable it will be then to take Butler's
original draught of human nature, and to mark how
it corresponds in every particular with this image of
God exhibited to us under four different points of
view in the evangelical narrative.    It would detain
us far too long to go into particulars; but two points
I may briefly throw out for further development in
meditation: first, the natural shrinking of our blessed
Lord from mental and bodily suffering, even to the
deprecation of it, " 0 my Father, if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me ;" * and yet the entire and
cheerful resignation with which He at length accepted
the cup, *' 0 my Father, if this cup may not pass
away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."t
What is the first of these but  the action of fear,
seconded by self-love, in the sinless humanity of our
Blessed Lord,—a self-love which naturally declines
pain,  both  bodily  and  mental,  and  all  the more
sensitively on account of the purity of the nature
in which it exists,—a self-love which is the nega-
tion of stoicism, no less than of weak  succumbing
to   calamity ?     And   what  is   tlie second,   but  an
exercise by Christ of that resignation to the will
of God, in which  Butler finds  the three elements
of  fear,   hope,  and   love,   and   of   which  he  says
that it " is the whole of piety," and " includes in
it all that is good; " and also an exercise of that

160 CLASSIC   PREACHERS :
benevolence and compassion, the claims of which to
govern our nature he has so grandly advocated, and
which redounded to the gratification of the Saviour's
own heart, when he saw of tlie travail of His soul,
and was satisfied. It was the love of God and the
love of His neighbour, which urged Him not to be
influenced by sensibility to present suffering (how-
ever keen), but to endure the cross for the joy that
was set before Him. This joy was a satisfaction to
reasonable self-love, which He must perforce have
fallen short of, had He declined the cup. And
again, as to resentment, the real object of which,
.Butler tells us, is "not natural but moral evil," not
suffering but injury, and the indulgence of which in
a measure, and as moral indignation against wrong-
doing, he so conclusively justifies, and points out the
use of,—who does not see that the inspired accounts
of our blessed Lord's character bear out entirely
all that he says on the subject; for while Christ is
not only the gift, but the impersonation, of Divine
love and mercy, are we not told of " the wrath of the
Lamb," and did not His wrath breakout with special
warmth—never, indeed, against personal outrage,
however insulting and cruel, but against hypocrisy
and empty shows of piety, in which the heart had no
part—and did it not culminate in that tremendous
denunciation, which yet consisted with strong and
compassionate yearning over the souls both of the
blind guides and those who ^^ere led by them : "Ye

serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape
the damnation of hell ? "*
(2). Another passage of Holy Scripture, which
Butler in his Sermons works out, though he does
not use it formally as a text, is the 14th verse of
the 139th Psalm: "I will praise Thee; for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made : marvellous are thy
works; and that my soul knoweth right welL" It is
clear from the context that the uppermost thought in
the mind of the Psalmist was the curious structure
of the human body, and the gradual building up of
the members into one organism. A passage in the
Epistle to the Romans,t in which the Apostle bor-
rows an illustration of his subject from the bodily
organism of man, stands at the head of Butler's first
Sermon, and this is the way in which he accommo-
dates it to the purpose of his argument : " Since the
Apostle speaks of the several members as having
distinct offices, which implies the mind, it cannot be
thought an allowable liberty, instead of the lod^j and
its members, to substitute the whole nature of man,
and all the variety of internal frincijples ivhieh belong
to it.'^ The truth is that the outward is but a symbol
and type of the inward ; and when the Holy Spirit,
who spake by the Psalmist, moved him to say that
he was " fearfully and wonderfully made," He doubt-
less had in view no less the intellectual and moral

" Undoubtedly," Butler would  answer   (if we may

venture to put words in his mouth), " there are
many wrong and criminal feelings in our hearts,
which we are bound to suppress, and to which no
quarter must be given; but if you will philosophi-
cally analyse these, you will iind that each of them
is the morbid excess, the undue and exaggerated de-
velopment, sometimes the monstrous caricature, of
an affection which, as it stood in our nature originally
when it came fresh from the hands of the Creator,
was perfectly innocent, holy, and good, and adapted
to the condition and circumstances of man." What
can be more criminal, or more mischievous, than
lust, as it is ordinarily exhibited in human life ?
what can be more essentially cruel than it is, or,
as Burns says, more hardening to all within, and
petrifying to the feeling ? * Yet the instinct, of
which the crime is a perversion, is, of course, de-
signed for, and essential to, the continuance of
the species, and, in the ordinance of holy matri-
mony, receives the authorization and consecration
of the most High. Is it possible to conceive that
this could be the case if it were in itself, apart
from its misdirection, perversion, and excesses,
wrong?     But resentment is the great instance by

which Butler ilhistratos his principle that " no
passion wliich God hath endued us with can be
of itself evil; and yet" that " men frequently in-
dulge a passion in such ways and degrees that at
length it becomes quite another thing from what it
was originally in our nature." * He shows that
what raises deliberate resentment, the object upon
which it fastens, is injury and wrong, whether to
ourselves or others; that " to prevent and remedy
such injury, and the miseries arising from it, is the
end for which " it " was implanted in man; " that
"fear of their fellow-creatures' resentment does, as
a fact, often restrain men from injuring others,
when they would not be restrained by a principle
of virtue ; " and that passionateness in strong
tempers, peevishness in weak ones, exaggeration of
injuries done to us, dogged refusals to be set right
as to erroneous impressions connected ^^ith offences,
are all "peculiarities of perverseness and wayward
humour," to be traced up to anger, indeed, but yet
not to be confounded with it in its original and
pure state—unwholesome fermentations of the ori-
ginal passion, produced by the leaven which has
wrought in man's heart since the fall, and which
has turned what was originally a generous wine
into acrid vinegar. The same leaven has wrought
similar  mischievous   results  upon   the  passion   of

emulation. Emulation is " the desire and hope
of equality with, or superiorit}^ over, others, to
whom we compare " ourselves," and the end which
it aims at bringing about is this equality or supe-
riority. We ought to be emulous of others in
respect of their virtues and graces, so that emula-
tion has a real place and function even in the
spiritual mind. For to what principle but emu-
lation did St. Paul appej^l, when he boasted to his
Macedonian converts of the promptitude and libe-
rality of the Church of Corinth in giving aims,
an appeal to wdiich the passion of emulation in
the Macedonians had responded; for "your zeal,"
says he to the Ccjrinthians, describing the effect of
his quotiijg their example, "hath provoked very
many."* But when emulation seeks not simply our
own equalit)^ with others, but the achievement of
this equality by the particular means of bringing
them down to our level, it then becomes envy, and
is corrupted into an unlawful passion, not to be
allowed harbour within the precincts of our nature.
Of the various passions and affections, of which we
are now speaking, there are some whose primary
intention is the security and good of the indi-
vidual (such, for example, as fear of danger, and
resentment, both which act as protections to the
individual);   others,   whose   primary   intention   is
* 2 Cor. ix. 2.
166 CLASSIC  PREACHEES:
rather the security and good of society (such, for
example, as desire of esteem, compassion, indig-
nation against successful vice, and so fortli).—
Above the other affections in rank, as being-
calmer, more free from turbid sediment, more
purely reasonable, more removed from mere in-
stincts and blind propensions, are those two ten-
dencies of our nature, self-love and benevolence,
the one lending its complexion to one class of the
lower affections, the other to the other. Each of
the subordinate passions rests in its own end, fear
in the security which it seeks, compassion in the
relief of misery, emulation in the winning of the
coveted superiority, resentment in the redress
(whether legal or otherwise) of an injury. But
these two higher tendencies, self-love and bene-
volence, have for their ends, the one our own
happiness and good, the other the happiness and
good of others. Butler calls attention to the fact
that men, m the pursuit of their passions, nearly
as often contradict self-love—act, i.e., in defiance
of their own good and happiness—as they do bene-
volence ; and that one who does so, who consults
present and immediate gratification, in preference
to what a reasonable self-love tells him is his real
interest, if called selfish, should be distinguished
from the man who, fiom undue self-love, subordi-
nates in his own mind the interests of others to his
own, and uniformly seeks the latter at the expense
BUTLEE. 167
of the former. The one, he suggests, should be
styled sensually selfish; the other, to whom alone
the term selfish is strictly appropriate, must be
called, by way of distinction, deliberately selfish.—
But now comes the highest of all faculties in
the reasonable soul of man, the conscience, which
Butler defines as " the principle of reflection in
men, by which they distinguish between, approve
and disapprove their own actions." This faculty,
if it were only that it implies an exercise of the
judgment or deliberating faculty, is evidently supe-
rior in rank to the affections and appetites, which
are mere propensities to certain external objects.
However weak the conscience may be in point of
fact, God has stamped authority upon its brow;
" to preside and govern, from the very economy
and constitution of man, belongs to it. Had it
strength, as it had right; had it power, as it had
manifest authority, it would absolutely govern the
world." Lord Shaftesbury, in his "Inquiry con-
cerning Virtue," had implied that, putting aside
our obligations to God, which the atheist does not
admit, a man wlio should seriously douht or deny
that virtue is conducive to happiness, ivoidd he
under no ohligation to folloiv it. Butler maintains
that such an obligation would still arise, from the
indisputable authority with which conscience is in-
vested, from the claim which it evidently makes to
absolute control over all the lower faculties; so that
168 CLASSIC  PREACHERS :
one who escbews virtue, and chooses vice, stands
condemned by the constitution of bis own nature,
without bringing in a reference to any judgment
passed upon liis conduct by an external authority.
We must not omit to observe that, at the beginning
of liis second Sermon, Butler distinctly recognises
" some diversity among mankind with respect to"
this faculty of conscience, and intimates that the
same standard of right and wrong does not uni-
formly prevail throughout the world or throughout
its different ages, thus showing that he regards
conscience not as a light, hut rather as an eye. An
eye may be partly closed or fully opened; it may
have a film over it; its mechanism may be de-
rauged, and the derangement may trouble its pos-
sessor with optical illusions; but light cannot mis-
lead, though the eye may; illusions can only be
dissipated, not engendered, by light. Conscience
is a judge, who deliberates upon evidence submitted
to him; the evidence proves, or fails to prove, what
it was brought to prove; but the judge may be
under a bias.
Such is (in outline) Butler's theory of the eco-
nomy of man's moral nature. And, abstruse and
difficult as, by his own confession, the subject is, and
ponderous and wanting in vivacity as most readers
will think his treatment of it to be, yet, when we
have once thoroughly mastered it, to what immense
practical account may it not be turned in the con-

duct of the spiritual life, as an aid to self-exami-
nation and self-discipline! In the great work of
our sanctification our own will must co-operate with
God's grace, if the mental and moral disorder into
which the fall has plunged us is to be set right.
But how can mental and moral disorder be satis-
factorily set right; how can we see to do our part
in the work of setting it right, unless we under-
stand something of the original structure which
was disorganized by sin? Could a physician hope
to prescribe successfully without some such know-
ledge of the human frame as is derived from study
in the anatomy school ? What chance would a
watchmaker have of meiiding a watch, who knew
nothing of the various wheels and springs which
constitute the machinery, who had never seen the
various parts of the interior taken to pieces and put
together? Nor is it only in self-government and
knowledge of our own hearts that Butler's studies
of human nature might greatly assist us. They
might act as preservatives against that pietism in
which even the most fervid piety is apt some-
times to run to seed, and might correct mistakes in
well-disposed and earnest minds, which, if uncor-
rected, might fret, discompose, and spiritually retard
them. Many an ascetic devotee among heathen
worshippers (and the morbid, tendency has not
unfrequently crept into and corrupted Christian
devotion) has professed that the end of all moral
170 CLASSIC  PIJEACHERS :
endeavour should be to get rid of self utterly; to
suppress, by force and rigour, its earliest and most
innocent movements, and, if possible, to extinguish
it altogether as a motive. The attempt has never
succeeded. If you try to crush self by the most
painful discipline of the animal nature, he en-
trenches himself all the more strongly in the for-
tress of spiritual pride. Butler would have taught
you that "reasonable self-love," no less than con-
science, is a "chief or superior princii)le in the
nature of man;" that " conscience and self-love, if
we understand our true happiness, always lead us
the same way;" that " duty and interest are per-
fectly coincident; for the most pait in this world,
but entirely and in every instance, if we take in the
future and the whole;" and that therefore neither
self-love nor our natural susceptibility to pleasure
and pain are to be, or, indeed, can be, suppressed,
but only controlled and guided.*
* As an instance of the loose- | cess); for the letters, from which
ness with which even devout
and able writers express tliem-
selves on the subject of self-love,
take the following, written by
one of the saintliest men and
most truly apostolic pastors who
the passage is an extract, are
headed, " On Selfishness." Thus
he writes to his children, under
date October 21, 1841:
" Learn, in the next place, to
consider self-love as that which
have graced the Church of Eng-    separates  us  from, and Divine
land in recent times. It is clear
that in reproving self-love he
intended to reprove selfishness
(its  morbid perversion and ex-
love as that which unites us to,
God and our neighbour. In
other words, learn to regard self-
love as the source of all disorder.

Again; it would not be difficult to imagine a
devout person taking up, from those passages of
Scripture, in wliicli anger is spoken of in the bad
sense as a passion depraved by the faW, tlie notion
that this affection should be wholly eradicated from
our nature; that it is to be cut away, root and-
branch; and that its every working in the heart
is to be regarded as a working of sin. Possessed
by this idea, he prays and strives against every
rising of the feeling, but with no success; he is
striving, if he could see the truth, after that Avhich
is not within the designs of God's sanctifying grace
for man; striving to eliminate certain original
affections from our nature, rather than to direct
and control them. It is a weary and disheartening
thing to strive for the unattainable; and if a person,
under the false view I have described, were to take
up Butler's " Sermon upon Resentment," and to be
taught by him that, apart from its perversions and
excesses, this passion has excellent and necessary
ends to answer; that its proper objects are injury,
injustice, and cruelty, by fastening upon which it
strife, and confusion; and Divine
love, as, at once, the parent and
the nnrse of all good order,
harmony and peace, whether in
families, or neighbourhoods, or
states ; leading us to see God in
everything, and ' to do our duty
in that state of life, to which it
may please God to call us.'"

does a public benefit, and becomes a security to
society; and that the Scripture, when haying re-
straint upon anger, does so guardedly, bidding us
to " be angry, and sin not" * (that is, not to
allow anger to pass into sin, by indulging it to
excess), and again denouncing punishment against
every one who is angry with his brother without
a cause,^ it is very possible tliat such a new light as
this upon the subject might seem to strike off
shackles, which had before galled and hindered him
in his spiritual course, and that he would thence-
forth go on his way rejoicing with lightened heart
and disencumbered conscience.
(3.) The last point with which we propose to
occupy the attention of our readers is the descrip-
tion which Butler gives, or, I should rather say,
which may be elicited from his Sermons, of the
corruption of our nature and the effects of the fall
of man. Judging from the Sermons upon Human
Nature, this corruption consists mainly in the dis-
organization of the moral system, in the fact of
conscience being dethronc^d, and of some unruly
passion or appetite usurping its place and governing
the soul. But W'C should wrong our bishop very
much if we represented this as being his entire
account  of the  disorder into  which  the  fall has

plunged our nature, or if we implied that the dis-
order itself was only incidentally noticed by him,
and not made the subject of separate consideration.
Again we are reminded of a passage of Scripture
which Butler has most grandly illustrated, without,
however, making it a formal text, or even expressly
referring to it: '^ The heart is deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"*
As to the exceeding deceitfulness of the natural
heart of man (one of the chief features of its
wickedness, and closely associated — as want of
truth always will be—with another feature, want
of love), was it ever more subtly analysed, more
wonderfully exposed, than in Butler's two Sermons
upon the character of Balaam, and upon Self-
Deceit? These discourses are, indeed, great mas-
terpieces of sj^iritual anatomy, showing how
adroitly men', in the exercise of self-deceit, will
frame a false conscience, by whose dictates they
will abide with the utmost punctiliousness, while
the true conscience is suppressed and held in abey-
ance, this being one of the tricks by which the man
will pass with himself for being a strict adherent to
the inner rule of right; and when to these is added
the Sermon before the House of Lords on the day
of the Martyrdom of King Charles I., in which he
draws  out  the   Scriptural  definition   of   the  term

174 CLASSIC preachers:
hypocrisy (" In Scripture, which treats chiefly of
our behaviour towards God and our own con-
sciences, hypocrisy signifies, not only the endeavour
to dehide our fellow-creatures, but likewise insin-
cerity towards Him and towards ourselves") we
must admit that, if we desire to be practically im-
pressed with the lesson that " the heart is deceitful
above all things," we can learn it nowhere so con-
vincingly as from Butler, and that the penetration
which his Sermons display into the secrets of the
human conscience, entitles him to a foremost place
among our English preachers.
It should be added that the Sermon upon Self-
Deceit not only urges the necessity of self-examina-
tion as a preservative from it, but also gives advice
for this exercise, which will be found of great service
in the conduct of it. How helpful for detecting the
blindness induced by self-partiality would those
rules of Butler's be, that we should consider what
parts of our own character and conduct would offer
most handle to an enemy bent upon disparaging and
defaming us, and watch ourselves specially in that
quarter, and that, in judging ourselves for any
part of our behaviour, we should imagine that our
neighbour had behaved in exactly the same way,
and consider what judgment lue should give upon
Jmn.
And is this all the account then that can be given
of the corruption of our nature, that it stands in the
BUTLEK. 175
rebellion of the passions against the authority of
conscience, which is their lawful soyereign, and in
the self-partiality and self-flattery which are perver-
sions of self-love,—winch are self-love in its excessive
and morbid actings ? All the account which un-
assisted reason can give, not all the account which
may be gathered by the help of Eevelation. Holy
Scripture teaches that the great principle of our
recovery from the ruins of the fall is faith—"the
substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen." Now there must be a correspondence, one
would think, between the fall and the recovery, as
between a disease and the remedy which cures it.
The remedy cures in virtue of some natural adapta-
tion which it has to the complaint. Tlie inference
therefore is forced upon us that the great spiritual
result of the fall was to bring man under the empire
of things which are seen, to make him a slave to the
visible, to loosen his grasp upon all such truths as
he cannot reach either by the senses or by ex-
perience, upon the being and presence of God and
upon his own immortality. He has noble aspirations
still; but time and sense lie like a collar round his
shoulder, and pin him down to the earth. His faith
was disabled on the moment of his fall. Thouo-h
still able to foresee, and ready to provide against, a
future,—yet it must be a future in time, of which
the race to which he belongs has had experience.
In his left hand he retains the sense of touch ; but
176 CLASSIC  PREACHERS :
the right hand,* wherewith he might grasp and feel
the solidity of the things which are not seen and are
eternal, is withered. This is the reason of the
phenomenon to which Batler frequently calls atten-
tion, that men for the present gratification of some
passion, so often act in direct violation of what they
know to be for their own interest. The reason is the
grasp which their senses, and all that is called in Scrip-
ture " the world," has upon them in virtue of their
fall,—the urgency with them of the present and the
visible. Connected with this urgency, there is one
point which we venture to think that Butler might
have drawn out more explicitly, without in the least
departing from his line of excluding Eevelatioii from
his view, in order to find evidences strongly cor-
roborative of its testimony in the structure of the
human mind. It has been reserved for a divine of
this century, the late Archdeacon Hare, to bring out
this point forcibly and fully in his Sermons on the
Victory of Faith. The j)oint is the extraordinary
combination in man of present gratification of passion,
though known to be adverse to his best interests,
with deliberate provision for a foreseen future in
time, which future the individual may not live to see.
The same man, who shows himself utterly unable to
resist a temptation to some excess of intemperance,
which he knows will tend to undermine his bodilv

health, will sow in anticipation of a harvest, which
he may never reap, will labour hard, year after year,
for a competence which he may never enjoy, will
even submit to toil and self-denial for the attainment
of some distinction which he may never win. Butler
would say that this is a case of passion in certain
points prevailing over reasonable self-love, while in
other points self-love prevails over the lower instincts,
such as love of ease, natural indolence, and averseness
to trouble. But there is something else in the
matter besides and beyond a mere compliance or
non-compliance with self-love. Hare shows most
conclusively that every success which man has
reached in his natural life, every realised result of
civilization, has been reached in the strength of
faith. Man has projected himself into the unseen
future, not by a blind or unintelligent instinct, like the
ant or the bee, but by deliberate and thoughtful fore-
sight. And this projection of himself into the future
is faith; it is the operation of a faculty on things
which come within human experience, and which,
as applied to things transcending human experience,
is the renovating faculty of our nature. Had Butler
seized this point, he might have made in his massive
solid style, a grand disquisition upon it, which would
have enriched our English literature with one more
great Sermon. Tersely and with sententious gravity
he would have prosecuted the great argument, which
Hare has dilated on so copiously, so expansively, and
[ST. JAMES'S.] N
178 CLASSIC  PEEACHEES:
with such warmth and glow of devout emotion. The
New Testament suspends the salvation of man on
the genuineness of his faith. Now, putting aside
Eevelation altogether, we find in our study of man
a principle of faith (if by faith be meant realization
of the unseen), which works, and works powerfully,
in his natural life. More than this ; we find that
this faculty of realizing the unseen has been the
principle by which man has won every success which
he has achieved, and by which every deed in human
history, which is good and great, has been done. It
is, in short, the one faculty, which raises man above
the beasts that perish, the faculty by which, in its
higher actings, he does or may take cognizance of a
God above him and an eternity before him. Butler,
faithful to his principle of borrowing nothing, not
even his terms, from Eevelation, calls this faculty
reason. And reason it is in the language of the
moral philosopher, and under one aspect of it, which
yet in the language of the Scriptures, and under
another aspect of it, is faith. Considered as a light
kindled by the Author of our nature in man's heart,
it is reason ; considered as a principle, which lifts us
above our immediate surroundings into a state of
things concealed from us at present, it is faith.
But to view it as faith has this advantage, that we
thus gain a strong evidence in favour of Eevelation,

selects as our moral and spiritual restorative, is the

very faculty to which all past improvements and
successes in man's natural life have been due.
But let us be thankful to Butler for the large
amount of independent evidence to Revelation which
his Sermons furnish, without venturing to complain
that he has not done in this line quite all that he
might have done. His manner is to be reticent; to
withhold much that he might advance ; to drop few
words, but weighty, into the ears of the wise. We
feel instinctively in reading his writings, that there
is a great power in reserve which he does not care
to display. Suffice it that in the independent study
of our nature he has arrived at evident and unques-
tionable traces of some great moral convulsion,
which somehow (it is not his business to say how), it
underwent. It is all disorganized,—a body politic
in a state of mutiny. Affections, perfectly whole-
some in themselves, have become morbid by some
perversion or degradation, which in reason there is
no accounting for. Self-partiality, the excess (or
rather caricature) of self-love, has brought in its train
all sorts of blindness and delusion, so that we are-
unable to see ourselves as others see us. The third
chapter of Genesis gives the key to this otherwise
unaccountable moral phenomenon. Man is a fallen
creature, by virtue of an act which his ancestors did,
in unhallowed ambition, and in gratification of their
senses. Ever since their descendants have groaned
under the bondage of the visible world, that lower

system of things " in which the lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eyes, and the pride of life," are the domi-
nant principles. Deliverance is to be had only by-
faith in that Redeemer, whose miraculous birth, and
passion, and triumph, were dimly and enigmatically
predicted in the course of the sentence upon the
arch-offender. But we cannot appreciate the remedy
without both study and personal experience of the
disease. And for the analysis of the disease, the care-
ful moral anatomy which brings it to light, and shows
us how poorly we realize the ideal of human nature,
as it existed in the mind and design of the Creator,
there is no work in English Theology like Bishop
Butler's Sermons,—none which shows so clearly how
accordant are the teachings of Revelation with the
indications of our own nature, as regards the end
for which we were made, the height from which we
have fallen, and the path which it behoves us to
pursue.

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF BISHOP BUTLEE.
Josi:pe Butler wavS born at Wantage in Berkshire,
the birthplace of Alfred the Gieat, May 18, 1692. His
father was a retired linen and woollen draper, who,
wishing to educate his son for the ministry of the sect
to which he himself belonged, that of the Presbyterians,
placed him at a very excellent academy at Gloucester
(afterwards removed to Tewkesbury), which turned
out several men of mark besides himself; among them
Archbishop Seeker, a constant friend to Butler during
his life, and the vindicator of his memory after his
death. It was here that, at the age of twenty-one, he
first showed his marvellous metaphysical power in a
correspondence with Dr. Samuel Clarke on certain diffi-
culties which had occurred to him in Clarke's famous
work, ' A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes
of God.' The correspondence was conducted with a
modesty which reflected as much credit upon Butler's
heart as the argument did upon his head, his name
being carefully concealed, and Seeker conveying the
letters to the Gloucester Post Office for him, lest his
incognito should be discovered. Was it the constitu-
tionally orthodox mind both of Butler and Seeker, or
the law, whose operation is not unfrequently seen, that
the children of parents with strong religious views
repudiate those views for themselves, or a certain
narrowness which all sects exhibit, and which is re-

consideration, declare for the Church of England ?
Butler's father, finding that no arguments of the Pres-
byterian divines were strong enough to shake his
son's resolution to desert the ranks of the Noncon-
formi.sts, sent him, at the age of two-and-twenty, to
Oriel College, Oxford; a nursing mother then, as in
later days, of intellectual celebrities. Here he formed
the acquaintance of Mr. Edward Talbot, son of the
then Bishop of Durham, and through their interest
and kindness reached his first steps of preferment, the
Preachership of the Eolls (1718), and the living of
Haughton near Darlington (1722), which he was
allowed shortly after to exchange for the richer benefice
of Stanhope. His year was divided now between his
duties as a parish priest at Stanhope, and those attach-
ing to his preacheiship at the Eolls. It was his power-
ful execution of these last duties which has given us the
famous ' Fifteen Sermons,' «pon which, as well as upon
the occasional Discourses annexed to them, must be
formed our estimate of his character as a preacher. At
Stanhope, Henry Philpotts, late Bishop of Exeter, on suc-
ceeding to the living, made every inquiry in his power
respecting " Hector Butler," his principal informant
being an old parishioner of ninety-three, who remem-
bered having frequently seen Butler some eighty years
ago. Beyond a tradition of the rector's " riding a
black pony, and riding always very fast" (the latter,
perhaps, not utteily insignificant as a trait of character ;

into the delineation of a character in Holy Scripture ?),

sensibility to the distresses of beggars, wbicli led him,
not indeed always to relieve them (one of his Sermons
shows that he held that practice to be injudicious and
nnjustifiable), but to run away from their importunities,
and seclude himself in his house,—scarcely any memo-
ries survived of the great philosopher and divine. His
friends thought that his talent was at Stanhope bound
up in a napkin and hidden in the earth; and when
Seeker, in his capacity as royal chaplain, preached
before Queen Caroline in 1732, he took the opportunity
of a conversation, with which Her Majesty honoured
him after the sermon, to mention his friend. The
Queen had thought that Butler was dead; but, on
making inquiry afterwards on this point, received from
Archbishop Blackburn the humorous reply; "No,
madam, not dead^ but buried.'' With the aid of such
friends as Seeker and Talbot, Butler was speedily
exhumed. The Queen, a great patroness of literary
men, at whose request Newton drew up his treatise on
"Ancient Chronology," and to whose influence Berkeley
and Seeker, as well as Butler, owed their advancement,
appointed him Clerk of her Closet in 1736, and in the
same year procured for him a stall at Rochester. Every
evening, we are told, from seven till nine, she commanded
his attendance upon her, in order to enjoy his conversa-
tion on philosophical and theological subjects—Berkeley,
Clarke, Hoadly, ^and Sherlock, frequently taking part
in the discussions. It was in 1736 that the great work
which has immortalised the name of Butler, ' The
Analogy of Natural and Eevealed Religion,' appeared.
The Queen is said to have greatly admired it; but
she can hardly have studied it deeply, for it is not
a book which can be mastered in a short time, and
Queen Caroline's days were numbered.    At the close of
184 BIOGRAPHICAL  NOTICE   OF
1737 she died, some weeks after receiving privately at
Butler's hands the Sacrament of the Holy Communion.
George II., however, showed himself mindful of the
interest which his consort had shown in Butler; and
Lord Chancellor Talbot, the brother of his early friend,
also warmly recommending him, he was consecrated to
the see of Bristol, December 3, 1738, by Archbishop
Potter, who in the previous year had been translated
from Oxford to Canterbury. His friend Seeker had
occupied the see of Bristol before him, from 1735 to
1737, and had been succeeded by Dr. Gooch, who held
it only for a single year. Butler's tenure of this very
poorly endowed see was to last twelve years. The
King's eye, however, was still upon him; and, by way
of compensating him for the great poverty of his see,
he was installed Dean of St. Paul's in the spring of
1740, a dignity the revenues of which enabled him, as
he used to say, to make extensive improvements and
additions to his palace at Bristol. On receiving this
preferment, he resigned Stanhope and his stall at
Rochester, and divided his year equally between the
duties of his deanery and those of his diocese. As to
the former of these duties, we are told that he never,
while in residence, failed to attend both the daily
services in the Cathedral. Building seems to have been
somewhat of a passion with him; and an architectural
decoration which he made in repairing and enlarging his
palace at Bristol, aroused a senseless outcry, and was
thought injudicious even by his friend Seeker, warmly
as he challenged the absurd inference drawn from it.
Over the holy Table in the palace chapel he placed a
white marble cross, about three feet high, which was
thrown up in relief by a slab of black marble, into
which it was sunk, and was surrounded by a frame of
BISHOP  BUTLER. 185
beautifully carved cedar-wood, the gift of the Bristol
merchants.    Some fifteen years after his death (in the
year 1767), an anonymous pamphleteer put forth the
calumny that he " died in the communion of a church
that  makes  use  of saints,   saints'  days,  and all  the
trumpery of saint worship,"  alleging,   as  one of the
grounds of this accusation, that he had "put up the
popish insignia of the cross in his chapel" at Bristol.
His attached  friend  Seeker  (who had become Arch-
bishop  of Canterbury in  1758) vindicated him from
these   aspersions   by  letters,   signed   " Misopseudes,"
which appeared in the 'St. James's Chronicle.'    Seeker
died in the August of the following year (1768);   so
that his vindication of Butler may be said to have been
one of the latest acts of his life.    As an act of constant
friendship, therefore,  it  raises our estimation of the
Archbishop; while at the same time a charge so ob-
viously false and spiteful, brought against a prelate so
eminent and of such established character as Butler,
might probably have been better left to expire by its
own inanity.   Men might be apt to think there is some-
thing in a charge, when the Primate of all England
condescends to enter the lists against it.    But, be this
as it may, it may soothe the wounded sensibilities of
the Protestant mind to reflect that this sad proof of
Butler's deflection from the pure faith of the Reformed
Church no  longer exists.     Bristol,  which  has  nobly
maintained to the  present  day  its character for ico-
noclasm, could not tolerate such an abomination; and
the white cross on the black ground perished in the
ruins of the episcopal palace,  when the mob in 1831
set fire to it.
Even in a memoir so cursory as the present, it is
quite impossible to pass over the reminiscence of Butler
186 BIOGRAPHICAL  NOTICE   OF
whicli has been preserved to us by Dean Tucker of
Gloucester. When Tucker was a minor Canon of
Bristol Cathedral, and curate of St. Stephen's Church
in that city, his abilities and energy attracted Bishop
Butler's notice, so that he made him his domestic
chaplain, and used his interest to obtain for him
further preferment. The story must be told in the
Dean's own words; we are inclined to think it the
most characteristic of all the anecdotes of the Bishop
which have come down to us :—
" The late Dr. Butler, Bishop of Bristol, had a
singular notion respecting large communities and
public bodies; a notion which is not, perhaps, alto-
gether inapplicable to the present case. His custom
was, when at Bristol, to walk for hours in his garden
in the darkest night which the time of the year could
afford, and I had frequently tbe honour to attend him.
After walking some time, he would stop suddenly and
ask the question, 'What security is there against the
insanity of individuals ? The physicians know of none ;
and as to divines, we have no data, either from Scrip-
ture, or from reason, to go upon relative to this affair.'
* True, my lord, no man has a lease of his understand-
ing, any more than of his life; they are both in the
hands of the Sovereign Disposer of all things.' He
would then take another turn, and again stop short:
* Why might not whole communities and public bodies
be seized with fits of insanity, as well as individuals ?'
* My lord, I have never considered the case, and can
give no opinion concerning it.' ' Nothing but this
principle, that they are liable to insanity, equally, at
least, with private persons, can account for the major
part of those transactions of which we read in history.'
I thought little," adds the Dean, " of that odd conceit
BISHOP  BUTLER. 187
of the Bishop at that juncture ; but I own I could not
avoid thinking of it a great deal since, and applying it
to many cases."
But we must hasten on to the few remaining events
of Butler's life. The King's favour, probably in con-
sequence of the late Queen's partiality for him, still
accompanied him. In 1746, when he had been eight
years at Bristol, he was appointed Clerk of the Closet.
And he might have stood, had it so pleased him, on
the highest pinnacle to which in this country eccle-
siastical ambition can aspire. For on the death of
Archbishop Potter, in 1747, the Primacy of all England
was offered to, and declined by him, with the observa-
tion that, " it was too late for him to try to support a
falling Church;" words which, while they attest his
modesty, and the true greatness of a soul weaned from
earthly ambitions, at the same time have a dash of con-
stitutional melancholy in them. The Church of Eng-
land in his day may have seemed to be, and may really
have been on the surface, torpid and unenergetic; and
still more depressing times were in store for her after
his death; but " as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose
substance is in them, when they cast their leaves,"
there was in her during all that dreary age a " holy
seed," which was " the substance thereof;" and the
energy and activity, which of late years has manifested
itself in our communion, are but the result of prin-
ciples which even then were working in the hearts of
English Churchmen, deep in the soil, but not yet ap-
parent above the surface. Three years after the offer
of the Primacy had been made to Butler (in 1750) the
see of Durham fell vacant, and was offered to Butler,
with a private intimation that the lord-lieutenancy
would be no longer attached to it, but conferred upon a
188 BIOGRAPHICAL  NOTICE  OF
secular peer. He declined it, in the first instance, on
the ground that " it was a matter of indiifeience to him
whether he died Bishop of Bristol, or of Durham ; but
not a matter of indifference to him whether the honours
of the see were invaded during his incumbency." It
must be well if in these days, when it is the fashion to
strip bare every eminent position not only of its emolu-
ments, but of every scrap of ancient prestige which has
clung to it from the earliest period, a similar spirited
reply were made by all those to whom the denuded
position is offered. In Butler's case the resistance
which he thought it right to make to the minister's
proposal was not allowed to outweigh his claims to the
high position. The see was again offered to him, and
the removal of its ancient honours not further insisted
upon. He did homage for the see on the 9th of Novem-
ber, 1750, and was enthroned at Durham the same day
by proxy. Horace Walpole's sneer at this translation,
vented in the course of the next year (1751), when the
bishops had offended him by offering no opposition
to the Eegency Bill, was as follows : " The Bishop of
Durham has been wafted to that see in a cloud of meta-
physics, and remains absorbed in it." The income of
the bishopric of Durham was large; and Butler spent
it, as a bishop should, in acts of large munificence and
hospitality. On one occasion, when applied to for aid
towards a newly-projected benevolent institution, he
called for his steward, and asked how much money he
had in his possession. On being told five hundred
pounds, he exclaimed, " Five hundred pounds ! What
a shame for a bishop to have so much! Give it away;
give it all to this gentleman for his new institution."
Three days in every week the Bishop entertained
publicly, with all suitable circumstance, the gentry of
BISHOP  BUTLER. 189
tlie county and neigiibourliood; while in private his
habits were simple and frugal even to plainness, and on
the other days, even when he was not quite alone, the
provision made for the table consisted of only two
dishes. But the way of life thus indicated was not to
continue long. Our prelate, having given a glimpse to
the world of the way in which it behoved a Prince-
Bishop to live, was soon to be withdrawn from it. In
1752 his constitution seemed to break up. Clifton was
resorted to, and then the waters of Bath, but with no
good effect. On Tuesday, the 16th of June, 1752, the
great Christian philosopher entered into the state
where all those mysteries which hang over religion,
both natural and revealed, and which not the subtlest
or profoundest understanding can enable man to resolve,
are made plain in the light of God's countenance. One
or two edifying anecdotes are told of his latest senti-
ments, for which probably (even if they have been
added to and touched up) there is some foundation in
truth. " In his dying moments the Bishop expressed it
as an awful thing to appear before the moral Governor
of the world" (a sentiment so coincident with the
whole strain of Butler's theology, that we can entirely
understand its recurring to him with peculiar force in
the solemn hour when flesh and heart were failing).
" On this his chaplain " (Dr. Foster) " expounded the
efficacy of the blood which cleanseth from all sin, and
in terms so adjusted to the felt and expressed apprehen-
sions of the dying prelate, that his last utterance was,
' 0, this is comfortable!' with which words on his lips
he expired." Butler must have been perfectly familiar
with the text 1 John i. 7 ; may have often studied it and
preached upon it; but now at length had come to him
the moment of spiritual subceptibility, when the testi-
100 BIOGEAnilCAL   NOTICE  OF
mony of " the cleansing blood " winged its way through
his soul with all the power of a spiritual coidial. And
as to the preliminary sense of awe, in the prospect of
appearing before God, this was a condition of the
comfort leaching him, and doubtless in such a character
as his was unusually deep. The wise man after the
flesh, if truly instructed in the knowledge of God and
of himself, has no other hope than that which supports
the rudest peasant's soul; nay, in proportion to the
amount of that knowledge is the depth of his humilia-
tion ; and " he fears as he enters into the cloud," even
though it be the bright cloud of God's presence and
smile. And so Bishop Butler entered into rest in the
comfortable faith of Chiist's atonement:—
" Just as I am, without one plea,
Save Ihat Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me trust in Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come."
A piece of information given us by the poet Cole-
ridge in his ' Table-talk' summarizes in three or four
lines the moral character of the man. Butler's was a
strong soul, liable to strong and stormy temptations;
the howling winds swept across it; the waves of passion
surged over it and rose mountain-high; but the i-eason
of the Christian Philosopher (which, as I have endea-
voured to show at the end of my Lecture on his charac-
ter as a preacher, is only faith in another aspect of it)
held the helm, and kept the vessel true to lier course,
"The great Bishop Butler," says Coleridge, "was all
his life struggling against the devilish suggestions of
his senses, which would have maddened him if he had
relaxed the stern watchfulness of his reason for a single
moment."
BISHOP  BUTLEE. 191
He was buried in his first Cathedral at Bristol, near
lie episcopal throne, on June 20, 1752, with as little
state as might be, Mr. Chapman, the Sub-dean of
Bristol, reading the Office for the Burial of the Dead.
The facts and anecdotes in the above ' Biographical
Notice' are almost all drawn from the Eev. Thomas
Bartlett's ' Memoirs of Joseph Butler, late Lord Bishop
of Durham' [London: John W. Parker, 1839]. The
world is much indebted to Mr. Bartlett for having col-
lected with great industry, and recorded with accuracy
and fidelity, every reminiscence which survived of his
illustrious kinsman by marriage ; one who has been
justly described as " not only pre-eminent in his own
day, but in the foremost rank of the immortalized sages
of the world."
